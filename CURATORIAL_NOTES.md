this is an inquirer and demo copy of the final build, do not share <3

the what: this emulator acts as a curation device that can be trustlessly deployed by anyone to fleek.

forked from mihaip/infinite-mac project and optimized to work on IPFS, you can use an aetherWorks-dev/aetherWorks-html-wrapper to create your own working interactive curation

the why's: decentralizing curation, interactivity, os'es as mediums, moving away from overused implementations of immersive-interactive experiences and towards net-art

the how's: wasm ports of mac emulators, the open source infinite mac project, fleek, html wrapping, zora, MEKsans

who is it for: artists, curators, marketplaces

the when: #soonâ„¢

the where: collectable on zora protocol, manifold(?), Transient(?)
