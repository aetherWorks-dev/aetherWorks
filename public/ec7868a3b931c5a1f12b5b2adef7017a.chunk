ving a script without compiling itWhen you save a script, it is usually compiled before it is saved. To save a script without compiling it:¥	Hold down the Shift key while choosing Save from the File menu.The Save dialog box appears, but you can only save the script as a text document.Save options for script applicationsWhen you save a script as an application, two additional buttons appear in the dialog box:¥	Stay Open.  Choose this option when you want your script to remain available after it runs (instead of quitting automatically). This can be useful when you want to send commands from another script to the open script.¥	Never Show Startup Screen.  Choose this option when you donÕt want the startup screen to appear. The startup screen displays the description of the script you write in the top part of the Script Editor window.Saving a script as run-onlyYou can save a script in a format that can be run but cannot be opened in the Script Editor (or any other application). This is called a run-only script. To save a script as run-only:1.	Choose Save As Run-Only from the File menu.2.	In the dialog box that appears, choose a location, specify a name, and choose a format for the script.You can save run-only scripts as compiled scripts or as applications. You cannot save a run-only script as text.3.	Click Save.Running a scriptTo run a script thatÕs in the active script window:¥	Click the Run button.ÊYou can also choose Run from the Controls menu.To stop a script thatÕs running, press the Stop button (or hold down the  key and type a period).To run a script application:¥	Double-click the icon of the script application.You can force the scriptÕs startup screen to appear by holding down the Control key when you open the script application.Viewing an applicationsÕs terminologyThe Scriptable Finder and every scriptable application has its own terminology, or dictionary, which is a set of words that you can use with it. You can open the Finder's dictionary or an applicationÕs dictionary in order to find out what terms are available and their syntax. To open a dictionary, follow these steps:1.	Choose Open Dictionary from the File menu.A dialog box appears in which you can select the Finder (inside the System Folder) or a scriptable application. 2.	Select the Finder (inside the System Folder) or application you want and click Open.The Dictionary window opens.3.	To see the details about using a term, click it.The details for using the term appear in the window.                   A suite is a set of terms that are related. The required suite is the most                   basic set of terms. The standard suite is the set of terms that every                   scriptable application should support. Most scriptable applications (such as the                   Scriptable Finder) also have their own suite of commands.ÊThe terms available in a dictionary are organized into suites. For example, the Finder Dictionary includes the required suite, the standard suite, and the Finder suite. Using different scripting systemsYou can use the Script Editor to write scripts for scripting systems other than AppleScript.                   A scripting system is software that lets you write scripts using a set of terms                   put together according to rules of syntax. AppleScript has one set of terms                   and syntactic rules. Other scripting systems offer different terms and rules. To use a different scripting system, you must first install the system. To find out how to install a specific scripting system, see the documentation that came with it. To use the Script Editor with an installed scripting system, choose the scripting system from the pop-up menu at the bottom of the Script Editor window.ÊFor more information about a scripting system you have on your Macintosh, see the information that came with the scripting system.Using different AppleScript dialectsThe examples in this guide are based on the English dialect of AppleScript. If you have the proper software installed on your Macintosh computer, you can use a different AppleScript dialect in the Script Editor.                  An AppleScript dialect is a version of AppleScript based on the words and                   syntax of a particular language (a human language or a computer language).                   The English dialect is based on the English language. AppleScript can resemble                   any language if there is an AppleScript dialect for that language.To choose a different AppleScript dialect, follow these steps:	1. Choose AppleScript Formatting from the Edit menu.	2. In the dialog box that appears, choose a dialect from the pop-up menu if more than one exists.ÊIMPORTANT  Be sure you understand the dialect you choose. When you choose a dialect, all the AppleScript terms in the Script Editor appear in that dialect. This can present problems if you donÕt understand the dialect.  Some dialects require that you have the proper system software in order to see themÑfor example, the AppleScript Japanese dialect requires Japanese system software in order to display scripts using Japanese characters.Displaying the Result windowWhen a script runs, some of its expressions can produce an outcome or a result. For example, the expression Ò2+2Ó produces the result Ò4.Ó When a script produces a result, it appears in the Result window. Some error messages also appear in the Result window.You can open the Result window at any time when you use the Script Editor. To open the Result window:¥	Choose Show Result from the Controls menu.The Result window opens. If the open script ran and produced a result, the result appears in the window.Pasting an object reference into a scriptYou can use the Paste Reference command (in the Edit menu) to paste an object reference into your script. An object reference is an AppleScript phrase that identifies an object in an application program. For example, the phrase Òword 3 of document 1Ó identifies an object in the Scriptable Text Editor. To paste an object reference into your script, follow these steps:1. Select an object in the Finder or in an application program.For example, to select a Finder object you can click the icon for your startup disk.2. Choose Copy from the Edit menu. 3. Make a Script Editor window the active window.You can choose Script Editor from the Application menu, or you can click an open Script Editor window.4. Choose Paste Reference from the Edit menu.The reference phrase is pasted into your script at the location of the insertion point. For example, you can paste the reference phrase for your startup disk (a Finder object.)You can paste references only from applications that support this particular feature. An application can be scriptable and recordable without allowing pasting of object references.2   Script Editor Command ReferenceFile menuNew ScriptOpens a new script window in which you can write or record a new script.Open ScriptÉOpens the script you select.Open DictionaryÉOpens a window containing all the terms you can use with an application program you select.CloseCloses the active window.SaveCompiles and saves the script in the active script window. If you have not saved the script before, you choose the format in which to save the script, the name, and the location.In the dialog box that appears, you can save a script in one of three formats:Compiled Script. This is the normal format. When you open a script saved as a compiled script, you see the script in the active script window of the Script Editor.Text. You can open a script saved as text in SimpleText or in most word-processing and text-editing application programs. This is the only format in which you can save a script that contains syntax errors.Application. This format saves your script as its own application program. When you open a script saved as an application, you see a window (or Òstartup screenÓ) containing the description of the script. The description is the information you entered in the description area of the window for that script. When you click the Run button in the startup screen, the script runs. You do not see a script window for the script. When you save a script as an application, you have two additional choices: Stay Open and Never Show Startup Screen.If you check Stay Open, the script stays open after you run it (instead of closing automatically after it is run). If you check Never Show Startup Screen, the script runs immediately when you open it, rather than displaying its description first.Note:  To save a script without compiling it, hold down the Shift key while you choose the Save command.Save AsÉSaves a copy of the script in the active script window. You specify a name and a location and choose the format in which to save the script. The new copy becomes the active script.Save As Run-OnlyÉSaves a copy of the script in the active script window as a compiled script or an application that cannot be edited. You specify a name and a location in which to save it.RevertReturns the script in the active script window to the way it was the last time you saved it. Any changes you made since the last time you saved the script are lost.Page SetupÉOpens a dialog box in which you can choose page size, orientation, and other printing options. The options you can choose depend on the printer you have selected in the Chooser.PrintÉPrints the script in the active script window. The name of the script and its description are also printed. Different parts of the script are printed in the font, size, style, and color you choose in the AppleScript Formatting dialog box. (To open the AppleScript Formatting dialog box, choose AppleScript Formatting from the Edit menu.)Set Default Window SizeSets the size of the active script window as the default. New script windows you open (by choosing New Script from the File menu) are automatically opened at the default size.QuitQuits the Script Editor.Edit menuUndoReverses the effects of your last action. If you choose Undo while recording a script, the last line you see in the script window is removed.CutRemoves selected text and places a copy on the Clipboard.CopyPlaces a copy of selected text on the Clipboard.PastePlaces a copy of the text thatÕs on the Clipboard at the location of the insertion point, in either the description area or the script area of the active script window.ClearRemoves selected text without placing a copy on the Clipboard.Paste ReferencePastes a scripting expression from the Clipboard into the script area of the active script window, at the location of the insertion point. The scripting expression is a referenceÑa phrase that identifies something in an application program. For example, Òstartup disk of application FinderÓ is a reference that is used with the Scriptable Finder. You can use the Paste Reference command only with application programs that support it.Select AllSelects all the text in the description area or script area of the active script window, whichever contains the insertion point.AppleScript FormattingÉOpens a dialog box in which you select the font, size, style, and color of text indicating various parts of scripts. Controls menuRecordStarts recording your actions as a script. Choosing Record is the same as clicking the Record button in the active script window.RunChecks the script in the active script window for syntax errors, and if no errors are found, compiles and runs the script. Choosing Run is the same as clicking the Run button in the active script window. StopStops the script that is currently running.Show ResultOpens the Result window. The Result window displays the outcomes of some types of expressions in scripts. (For example, a script with the expression Ò2+2Ó would display Ò4Ó in the Result window.)Font and Style menusYou use the Font and Style menus to change the font, size, style, and color of:   ¥	selected text in the description area of a script window   ¥	text indicating different parts of a scriptAny changes you make to the formatting of the text in the description area also appear in the startup screen when the script runs.To change the font, size, style, or color of selected text in the description area:	1.	Select the text in the description area of the active script window. 	2.	Choose the font and size you want from the Font menu.	3.	Choose the style and color you want from the Style menu.To change the font, size, style, or color of text indicating different parts of scripts:	1.	Choose AppleScript Formatting from the Edit menu.	2.	In the window that appears, click to select one of the parts of a script.	3.	Choose the font and size you want from the Font menu.	4.	Choose the style and color you want from the Style menu.	5.	If you want, select another part of a script, then repeat steps 3 and 4.________________________________________________________________ğ Apple Computer, Inc.This manual and the software described in it are copyrighted by Apple, with all rights reserved.
