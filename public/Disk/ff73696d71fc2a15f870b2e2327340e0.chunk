With Find and Replace you can:¥	Find all occurrences of a word, phrase, or series of characters in a document or in a selection.¥	Find and replace text with specific formats, such as bold or underline. For example, you can replace Title with Title.¥	Find and replace formatting, including styles, without replacing text.¥	Find and replace special characters such as tabs, paragraph marks, and optional hyphens.To include hidden text in a search, display it on the screen by selecting Hidden Text in the View category of the Preferences dialog box (Tools menu).Note:  If you select text before choosing the Find or Replace command, by default Word searches only within the selection. To search the entire document, donÕt select text before choosing the Find or Replace command, or choose an option other than Selection in the commandÕs Search box.ø	Searching for text or formats1.	From the Edit menu, choose Find.2.	In the Find What box, type the text youÕre searching for.	To search for a special character, select it in the Special box.	To search only for formatting or a style, delete the contents of the Find What box.3.	To further control the search, do one or more of the following:¥	To search for formats or styles, click buttons or choose styles, fonts, or point sizes on the ribbon and ruler.	ÑorÑ	Select Character, Paragraph, or Style in the Format box and specify the formats or styles you want.¥	To remove existing formats, select Clear in the Format box.¥	To select the direction to search in the document, select an option in the Search box: This option	SearchesDown 	From insertion point to end 	of document Up 	From insertion point to top of 	document All 	The document from top to 	bottomSelection 	Only within the selection¥	To find only separate words, not characters embedded in other words, select Match Whole Word Only. For example, if you type light in the Find What box, Word finds light but skips delight.¥	To find only words that have a particular pattern of uppercase and lowercase letters, select Match Case.4.	To begin searching, choose Find Next.	Word selects the first occurrence of the text and scrolls to the document to display it. To find the next occurrence, choose Find Next again.	To edit the text, click in the document. To continue the search after editing, choose the Find command again, and then choose Find Next.Note:  Footnotes, headers, and footers are not included in a document search.

The Equation Editor is easier, but you may want to use the typesetting commands if you are already familiar with them, or if you are using System 6 without MultiFinder.For information about the Equation Editor, see the Microsoft Equation Editor UserÕs Guide  or the Equation Editor online Help.The syntax for a formula-typesetting command is:þ commandþ option(argument,argument)You precede formula-typesetting commands and options by inserting (not typing) formula characters (.\). Options provide additional information and often determine alignment or spacing. Arguments are printed according to the instructions in the command that precedes them. You enclose arguments in parentheses and separate a series of arguments with commas.For example, to create  Bbc{(T89), use the following:þ BþBCþ{(T89)The B command indicates braces, and the BC option (which does not require measurements) indicates braces on both sides of the expression. To display the numbers in superscript, use the ribbon or the Character command on the Format menu.For detailed information on the formula-typesetting commands and options, see Appendix H, ÒFormulas,Ó in the Microsoft Word UserÕs Guide.Word also provides a formula glossary, which includes some frequently used formulas, equations, Greek characters, and other symbols for you to insert in your documents. For more information, see the document ÒFormula Glossary InformationÓ on the Word disks.Important: To display and print formulas, the Symbol font must be installed in the System folder. (See ÒFonts and Point Sizes.Ó)ø	Typing a formula1.	If nonprinting characters are not displayed, click the show/hide ¦ button on the ribbon.2.

First designate text as index entries with the Index Entry command, and then compile the index with the Index command.When you identify text as an index entry, Word inserts codes in your document and formats the codes as hidden text. Word places an index code (.i.) in front of an entry and an end-of-entry code (;) after it.When you compile the index, Word places it at the end of your document and automatically inserts the correct page numbers.An index can be a simple index with only one level of entries (run-in) or a more complex index with subentries (nested). To create a run-in index, index entries must include subentries.This typeof index	Looks like thisRun-in	Bodies of Water: Lakes, 7; Rivers, 4Nested	Bodies of Water		Lakes 7		Rivers 4You can also create indexes that include commas or other characters between text and page numbers, entries that refer to text instead of page numbers, and a page range for topics that cover several pages. For more information, see Chapter 30, ÒIndexes and Tables of Contents,Ó in the Microsoft Word UserÕs Guide.You can change the default formatting of an index by redefining the automatic index styles (Index 1 through Index 7). See ÒStyles: Creating and modifying styles.ÓYou can compile an index for a single document or for a series of connected documents. To create a series of documents, see ÒDocuments: Connecting in a series.ÓTip:  If your document contains a large number of index entries (more than 1,500), itÕs a good idea to compile partial indexes and combine the indexes later. See ÒCompiling an index,Ó later in this topic.Note:  Dialog box options for the Index command are listed at the end of this topic.ø	Inserting an index entry1.	Select the text (up to 252 characters) that you want to be an entry in the index, or position the insertion point where you want to type the entry.2.	From the Insert menu, choose Index Entry.	Word inserts the index codes. If the index entry immediately precedes a paragraph mark, Word does not include the end-of-entry code.3.	If you did not select text, type the index entry.	Word formats the text as hidden text. To see index codes and other hidden text on the screen, select Hidden Text in the View category of the Preferences dialog box (Tools menu).ø	Compiling an index1.	Insert index entries into your document.2.	From the Insert menu, choose Index.3.	Under Format, select Nested or Run-in.4.	To compile a complete index, select All.ÑorÑFor this partial 	In the From and Toindex	boxes, typeAlphabetic 	A range of letters (for	example, a in the From box 	and m in the To box)Numbered only 	Numbers (both boxes)Numbered and 	A number in the From boxalphabetic 	and a letter in the To boxOnly one number 	The same number or letteror letter 	(both boxes)5.	Choose Start.	Word collects the index entries you specified and places the index at the end of the document.	If an index already exists, Word asks if you want to replace it. If you choose No, Word places the new index after the existing index, separated by a section break. Before you print the final index, delete all section breaks between indexes except the first one.Note: If Word displays a message that no entries were found, or if some entries do not appear, make sure that the index codes and end-of-entry codes are formatted as hidden text.ø	Creating an index subentry1.	Position the insertion point where you want to type the index subentry.2.	From the Insert menu, choose Index Entry.3.	Between the index code and the end-of-entry code, type the main entry text, followed by a colon (:). For example, type Tuxedo:4.	Type text for each subentry, up to seven levels, with each level separated by a colon. For example, type:	Tuxedo:jacket styleTuxedo:jacket style:morning coatTuxedo:tails style	To create these entries in the index:	Tuxedo	jacket style 69		morning coat 71	tails style 46Index command options (Insert menu)Format Controls the appearance of index subentries.	Nested Displays subentries below the main entry and indented to the right. Subentries can have a different style from the main entry.	Run-in Displays subentries on the same line as the main entry. Subentries have the same style as the main entry.Index Characters Determines whether Word compiles a complete or partial index.	All Creates an index for the entire document.	From, To Creates a partial index. The index begins with entries having the letter or number in the From box and ends with those having the letter or number in the To box.	Word lists numbered entries before alphabetic entries. If you type a letter in the From box, Word does not accept a number in the To box.Start Compiles the index and places it at the end of the document.Cancel Cancels the command.To insert large portions of a file into another document, use the File command on the Insert menu. Using the File command is more efficient than using cut and paste.Note:  Dialog box options for the File command are the same as those for the Open command. (See the command options in ÒDocuments: Opening.Ó)ø	Inserting a file in an open document1.	Position the insertion point in the document where you want to insert another file.2.	From the Insert menu, choose File.3.	In the files list, double-click the file you want to insert.	Word inserts the entire file; delete any portions of the file that you do not want.With the Date command, you insert a placeholder for the current date into your document. Every time you open or print the document, the date changesÑthe current date is displayed or printed.The Date command inserts the standard Word glossary entry ÒPrint DateÓ into your document. For more information on glossaries, see ÒGlossaries: Saving text entries.Óø	Inserting the current date1.	Position the insertion point where you want to insert the date.2.

You link information by copying a selection (the source) and pasting it in another location (the destination). You can edit the information in a source at any time.With System 7, any changes you make to the source are automatically sent to the destination, unless you specify otherwise. The destination can be in the same document, in another document, or in another application.You can create links between applications that support dynamic data exchange, such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. The applications containing linked information must be on your Macintosh.With System 6, you can create links between Word and other applications, but not between two Word documents. You can only link Formatted Text (RTF), and links are not updated automatically. For more information, see Appendix B, ÒExchanging Information Using System 6,Ó in the Microsoft Word UserÕs Guide.You can create a link using the Paste Link command, or, if you want to paste the information in a specific format, you can use the Paste Special command. Once you create a link, you can use the Link Options command to:¥	Specify the frequency for updating linked information¥	Open the source document and make changes to the linked information¥	Edit the link information if you move or rename the source¥	Cancel the link¥	Change the format of the linked information at the destination (not available in System 6)Note:  Dialog box options for the Paste Special and Link Options commands are listed at the end of this topic.Tip:  With System 7, you can share information between Word documents and with other applications. If you want to update information regularly:¥	To update within one document or between applications on one machine, use linking¥	To share information between several applications or machines, use publish and subscribeIf you want to include information from other applications in only one Word document, use embedding.ø	Creating a link1.

The result is also copied to the Clipboard so that you can paste it directly into your document.The text you select can be in a paragraph, multiple paragraphs, or in a row or column in a table.When you perform calculations, include the following mathematical operators:To	Use	ExampleAdd	+	4 +3	or	white space	4  3Subtract	-	12-9	or	()	12(9)Divide	/	700/12Multiply	*	12*583Calculate 	%	155.79*6%percentage		(% must be after		the number)Word calculates from left to right within a line, and line by line from top to bottom.Tip:  You can type numbers on the numeric keypad by first pressing the Num Lock key. When you no longer want to use the numeric keypad for numbers, press the Clear key.ø	Performing math calculations1.	Type numbers and operators.	If you donÕt type an operator, Word automatically adds numbers.2.	Select the numbers and operators. To select a	Do thisTable column	Click the selection bar at the 	top of the column.Tabbed column	Hold down Option and drag 	across the column.Table row	Double-click the selection bar 	to the left of the row.3.	From the Tools menu, choose Calculate.	Word displays the result in the lower-left corner of the window and places a copy on the Clipboard.4.	Position the insertion point where you want to insert the result and choose Paste from the Edit menu.Notes¥	You can specify a negative number by enclosing it in parentheses. Word also observes parentheses in expressions. For example, if you type 25+(5*20), the result is 125. If you type 25(5), the result is 20. That is, 25-5=20.¥	Word ignores text, currency symbols, and punctuation (except decimal points and commas).¥	Word displays an error message when the answer is greater than 99,999,999,999,999 or when you attempt to divide by zero.¥	In numbers, do not use a space to separate thousands from hundreds. During a calculation, Word interprets a space as an addition operator. For example, if you type 3 000+1 000 the result is 4. Type 3000+1000 for the correct result of 4000. (If your system allows a commaas a decimal separator, you can also type 3,000+1,000)You can merge documents to create unique versions of items such as form letters, mailing labels, and legal documents. The Print Merge Helper command on the View menu guides you through three basic steps for merging documents:¥	Creating a data document  to contain the text that is different for each version of the merged document.¥	Creating a main document  to contain the text that you want to be identical in each printed version.¥	Combining the two documents using the Print Merge Helper bar or the Print Merge command.In the data document, you group related information into records.  For example, all the information about one customer can be contained in one record.Each record is composed of one or more named fields. For example, a customer's record could contain a name field, an address field, and an account number field.In the main document, you insert the field name for each field you want to include in the merged document. The information in the field, which varies from record to record, will be merged into a copy of the document when you print.You can create either the main document or the data document first. This topic assumes that you know how to create and save documents in Word, but have not yet created either document. For information on working with documents you have already created, such as documents from other applications, see Chapter 33, ÒPrint Merge Basics,Ó in the Microsoft Word UserÕs Guide.Merge instructions establish the requirements for including data records in a merge. For example, you can use a merge instruction to print only the records that meet specific criteria and skip the records that donÕt meet that criteria. For more information, see ÒMerging documents: Merge instructionsÓ and Chapter 33, ÒPrint Merge Basics,Ó in the Microsoft Word UserÕs Guide.Note:  The following are listed at the end of this topic:¥	Dialog box options for the Print Merge and Print Merge Helper commands and the Data Document Builder dialog box¥	Descriptions of the options and buttons on the Print Merge Helper barø	Creating print merge documents1.	Choose New from the File menu to open a new document, which will become your main document.2.	Type and format the standard text as you would in any document. Type the text, spaces, punctuation marks, and other information that you want to print in every version of the document.	You can also type placeholder text for the information that will vary with each document.3.	Position the insertion point at the beginning of the main document.4.	From the View menu, choose Print Merge Helper.	Word displays a dialog box for you to choose an existing data document or create a new one.5.	Choose New.	Word displays the Data Document Builder dialog box.6.	Type the name of each field, pressing Return after each. Word changes all letters you type to lowercase.	Field names can have up to 253 characters, including spaces. DonÕt use OR, AND, or NOT as separate words in field names. For example, use dogs_and_cats but not dogs and cats.	You can enter the field names in any order. If you want to insert a field name at a specific point in the list, type the field name, select the field you want it to follow, and press Return.7.	Choose OK.	Word opens an untitled document for the data document and displays the Save As dialog box.8.	Type a name for the data document and choose Save.	Word inserts a table with two rows of cells into the data document, and lists the field names in the first row (the header record ).	Word then switches to the main document and inserts a DATA instruction at the beginning of the main document. The DATA instruction tells Word the name and location of the data document to merge with the main document.9.	Choose Save As from the File menu, type a name for the main document, and choose Save.	Word displays the Summary Info dialog box. Fill in the information, or leave it blank and choose OK.	You can now insert field names from the data document in the main document or type information in the data document. However, you must complete both procedures before you can merge the documents.ø	Inserting field names in the main document1.	Open the main document by doing either of the following:¥	Choose the document from the Window menu.¥	Use the Open command from the File menu. 2.	If the Print Merge Helper bar is not displayed, choose the Print Merge Helper command from the View menu.3.	Make sure that the DATA instruction is at the beginning of the main document and that no text, spaces, or blank lines precede it.4.	Position the insertion point at the first location you want to print variable information. If you typed placeholder characters, select those characters.5.	In the Insert Field Name list on the Print Merge Helper bar, choose the appropriate field name.	Word inserts the field name enclosed within the print merge characters (Ç È). You can insert the same field name more than once.6.	Repeat steps 4 and 5 at each location you want to insert information from the data document.Type information in the data document, if you have not already done so. Then merge the main document and the data document.Tip:  You can also insert print merge characters by pressing Option+\ and Shift+Option+\ or by using the Print Merge glossary entry. For more information on glossaries, see ÒGlossaries: Saving text entries.Óø	Typing information in the data document1.	Open the data document by doing either of the following:¥	Choose the document from the Window menu.¥	Use the Open command from the File menu. 2.	Beginning with the first empty cell, type the information for each field. 	Press Tab to move to the next cell, to start a new record, and to leave a cell blank. DonÕt type spaces in empty cells.3.	From the File menu, choose Save.4.	Fill in the summary information, or leave it blank and choose OK.Insert field names from the data document in your main document, if you have not already done so. Then merge the main document and the data document.Note:  Even when field information wraps within a cell, it wonÕt wrap within the main document unless it is at the end of a line. To print a field on more than one line, press Return to insert a paragraph mark (¦) or Shift+Return to insert an end-of-line mark (ù). If you include a paragraph mark in a field, its paragraph style and formatting will affect the paragraph in the main document that contains the field.ø	Adding a new field in a data documentWhen you use the Print Merge Helper to create a data document, Word inserts a table to contain your data. You can work with this table as you would any table in Word. (See the ÒTablesÓ topics.)Note:  The order in which you insert fields does not affect the merged document.1.	In the data document, do one of the following:¥	Click in the column to the right of where you want the new field. (Word will insert a new column to the left of the insertion point.)¥	Place the insertion point just in front of the end-of-row mark to insert a new field at the end of the first row of cells. (If the end-of-row marks are not visible, click the show/hide ¦ button on the ribbon.)2.	From the Format menu, choose Table Layout.3.	Select Column.4.	Choose Insert.5.	Type a name for the new field in the top cell of the column and fill in the data.	Field names can have up to 253 characters, including spaces. DonÕt use OR, AND, or NOT as separate words in field names. For example, use dogs_and_cats but not dogs and cats.When you switch to the main document, you can now select the new field name in the Insert Field Name list on the Print Merge Helper bar.ø	Merging a main document and a data document1.	Make sure the main document is the active document and contains a DATA instruction that identifies the data document. The DATA instruction must be the first item in the main document. 	The data document doesn't have to be open.2.	Do one of the following:¥	To merge every record, click one of the buttons on the Print Merge Helper bar:Click	ToK	Scan the main document and data 	document for errors. For example, 	Word will find a field name in the 	main document that is not in the data 	document.L	Merge the documents and place them 	in a new document to let you check 	documents before printing. Merge 	documents are named Merge1, 	Merge2, Merge3, and so on.M	Merge and print each version of the 	main document.¥	To merge a range of records, choose Print Merge from the File menu and type the range in the From and To boxes. Then, under Merge Results, select the option for the result you want and choose OK. (See ÒPrint Merge dialog box command options,Ó later in this topic.)If Word canÕt find the data document specified in the DATA instruction, you are asked to locate it. Select it and choose Open.If Word encounters an error during a print merge, it explains the error and selects it in the data or main document. (See ÒMerging documents: Troubleshooting.Ó)Tip:  Text formatted as hidden in a data document will also be hidden in the main document when you merge. ø	Canceling merging÷	Press Esc or +Period.Print Merge Helper dialog box options(View menu)If you choose the Print Merge Helper and there is no DATA instruction at the beginning of the main document, Word displays this dialog box.Files list Lists all documents and folders on the current disk or in the open folder.List heading Displays the location of the selected file or folder.List Files Of Type Determines the type of files in the files list.

This number is based only on the records that are successfully merged.	RecordNumber Inserts the number of the record in the data document. This number is based on all records in the data document.	For example, if there are 10 records in a data document and only 4 match the criteria for a print merge, the last record that is merged will have the record number 10 and the sequence number 4.	Define New Field Inserts and defines a new field to use for an ASK or SET instruction. The field is not added to the data document. To define a new field in the data document, see ÒAdding a new field in a data document,Ó earlier in this topic.Insert Keyword Inserts the merge instruction (IF...ENDIF..., IF, ELSE, ENDIF, ASK, SET, INCLUDE, NEXT, DATA, or Calculations) you select into the main document at the insertion point. Word displays a dialog box so that you can specify the necessary information. (See ÒMerging documents: Merge instructions.Ó)Print merge buttons Perform the same print merge operations that are available in the Print Merge dialog box.K	Scans the main and data documents for 	errors and alerts you if errors are found. 	This option does not merge documents.L	Merges the documents and places them in a 	new document named Merge1, Merge2, 	Merge3, and so on. M	Merges the documents and prints all 	versions of the merged document.Merge instructions are special instructions placed in the main document that establish criteria for information to be included in a merged document. For example, the DATA instruction identifies the data document that will be used. The IF instruction includes text and/or field information only if a specified condition is met. You can also use merge instructions to print variable information that is not defined in a data document, include another document in the main document, and print the results of calculations.The basic procedure for inserting a merge instruction into the main document is presented in this topic, followed by a brief description of each merge instruction. For more information, see Chapter 33 ÒPrint Merge Basics,Ó in the Microsoft Word UserÕs Guide.ø	Inserting a merge instruction into the main document1.	Position the insertion point in the main document where you want to insert the instruction.2.	From the View menu, choose Print Merge Helper.	If you have not inserted the DATA instruction, Word displays a dialog box asking you to choose or create a data document. Do one of the following:To	Do thisMerge data from 	Select the data documentexisting data document	and choose OpenMerge data using only	Choose NoneASK, SET, INCLUDEand/or CalculationsCreate a new data	Choose Newdocument3.	In the Insert Keyword list of the Print Merge Helper bar, choose the instruction you want.4.	When Word displays a dialog box prompting you for more information, type the information or select options in the dialog box as necessary.Merge InstructionsDATA instruction Identifies the name and location of the data document you are merging with the main document. The DATA instruction must be the first item in the main document and cannot be preceded by any spaces or other characters.Word automatically inserts a DATA instruction in the current document when you choose or create a data document using the Print Merge Helper.You can merge a different data document with the main document by replacing the existing DATA instruction with a new DATA instruction. Select DATA from the Insert Keywords box and then select an existing data document and choose Open, or create a new document by choosing New.Note:  If you type a different data document name instead of selecting the name from the Print Merge Helper bar, you must perform a merge action to update the fields. For example, you must check for merge errors or switch to another document and then return to the main document.Forms of the DATA instruction:ÇDATA data document nameÈÇDATA header document name,data document nameÈThe second form specifies the header document when the header record is not in the same document as the data records.If the data document name includes a comma, Word automatically encloses the data document name in quotation marks in the DATA instruction.IF, ENDIF, and ELSE instructions In each version of the merged document, IF prints the text you specify only if certain conditions are met. ELSE prints alternative text if the conditions are not met.You must always pair an IF instruction with an ENDIF instruction.You choose IF... ENDIF... from the Insert Keywords box and then choose a field name, operator, and value (text or numbers). You can select any of the following operators:=	Equals<	Less than<=	Less than or equal to>	Greater than>=	Greater than or equal to<>	Not equal toNot empty	Field contains any value or text dataForms of the IF instruction:ÇIF field nameÈ text to print ÇENDIFÈPrints the text if the field contains any data for the current record.ÇIF field name=numberÈ text to print ÇENDIFÈPrints the text if field information matches the specified number.ÇIF field name="text to match"È first text ÇELSEÈ other text ÇENDIFÈPrints first text if field information matches specified text; otherwise, prints alternative text you type after ELSE.ÇIF field name1=""ÈÇfield name2ÈÇENDIFÈIf field 1 is empty, prints the text from field 2.Note:  To set multiple conditions in a single IF instruction, you can use the following logical operators:¥	AND, which includes records meeting both of two conditions.¥	OR, which includes records meeting at least one condition.¥	NOT, in which the field must not match the specified condition.For more information, see Chapter 33, ÒPrint Merge Basics,Ó in the Microsoft Word UserÕs Guide.ASK and SET instructions Print variable information that is not defined in a data document.To print different information in each version of the merged document, use ASK. Word prompts you to supply information for the field before printing each version.To print the same information in all versions of the merged document, use SET. You can specify the text to be printed within the SET instruction, or have Word prompt you to fill it in.Both instructions must come after the DATA instruction. If they are on a line by themselves, they produce a blank line in the merged document. To prevent blank lines, see Chapter 35, ÒForm Letters and Other Merged Documents,Ó in the Microsoft Word UserÕs Guide.For both instructions, you select the instruction from the Insert Keyword box and select a field in the list or choose Define New Field and type a new name that is not used in the data document or in another SET or ASK instruction.In the SET dialog box, specify the field value in the instruction by choosing = and typing a value. If you want Word to prompt you, choose =? and type the prompt. In the ASK dialog box, type a prompt. You can type up to 253 characters in a prompt, including the keyword, field name, operator, and field value or prompt text. Note:  If the only instructions you are using in your document are ASK and SET, you donÕt need to include a DATA instruction. When you choose the Print Merge Helper and are asked to select the data document, choose None.Forms of the ASK instruction:ÇASK field name=?È Word displays the standard prompt to enter the field value: ÒEnter field name.ÓÇASK field name=?prompt textÈWord displays the prompt text you type as each version of the document is merged.Forms of the SET instruction:ÇSET field name=text to printÈPrints the specified text for the field in all of the merged documents.ÇSET field name=?È Word displays the standard prompt to enter the field value: ÒEnter field name.ÓÇSET field name=? prompt textÈWord displays the prompt text you type when the first version of the document is merged.INCLUDE instruction Inserts a document into the current document at the instructionÕs location. The documents are stored separately and merged during printing. You can insert another Word document or any file with a format that Word recognizes.You select INCLUDE in the Insert Keywords list, select the name of the document to include, and choose Open. This locates the document, but does not actually open it.You do not need a DATA instruction in a document that contains only an INCLUDE instruction. Make sure you print the document using the Print Merge command (File menu), instead of the Print command.A document specified in an INCLUDE instruction cannot be the document that contains the INCLUDE instruction (a document canÕt include itself), and it cannot contain a DATA instruction. For more information, see Chapter 33, ÒPrint Merge Basics,Ó in the Microsoft Word UserÕs Guide.Form of the INCLUDE instruction:ÇINCLUDE document nameÈInserts specified document in place of INCLUDE instruction.NEXT instruction Prints information from different data records in the same merged document. For example, you can print several addresses to fill one label form, or print a membership address list in a single document.When you select NEXT in the Insert Keyword list, Word inserts a NEXT instruction, enclosed in print merge characters (Ç È). Field information is drawn from the next record in the data document.Form of the NEXT instruction:ÇNEXTÈÇnameÈÇcompanyÈÇNEXTÈÇnameÈÇcompanyÈÇNEXTÈÇnameÈÇcompanyÈ(and so on....)Prints information from the ÒnameÓ and ÒcompanyÓ fields of each data record without starting a new version of the merged document.Tip:  You can skip a record by placing a NEXT instruction on the first line, next to the DATA instruction. For example: ÇIF paymentÈÇNEXTÈÇENDIFÈ ÇINCLUDE letterÈCalculations instruction Prints the results of calculations in the main document. You can include numbers in a calculation or specify a field name. Word uses the value of the field in computing the result. You can also use Calculations to evaluate a field in an IF instruction and to set values for fields in a SET instruction.You select Calculations from the Insert Keyword box. Then type a value or select a field name from the Field or Value box, and select +, -, *, or /. Word includes the operators in the computation in the order they appear. Expressions in parentheses are calculated first. If you use a field name in a calculation, the value must be defined in a data document or in an ASK or SET instruction preceding the calculation.Examples of calculations:Çitem cost+taxÈPrints the sum of two fields.ÇSET refund=Çitem cost+taxÈÈSets the value of refund  equal to the value of item cost  plus tax.This topic describes some problems you may encounter when merging documents. Each problem is presented in bold and followed by suggestions for correcting it.The data document or main document is printed separately; the documents are not merged.1.	Make sure that the main document is the active document.2.	Do either of the following:¥	On the Print Merge Helper bar, click the merge to printer icon:	M	(If the Print Merge Helper bar is not available, choose Print Merge Helper from the View menu.)¥	From the File menu, choose Print Merge (not Print).Field names are printed in the main document.÷	Do both of the following:¥	Use the Print Merge command to print the document, not the Print command.¥	Enclose the field names with print merge characters: ÇÈ	Use the Print Merge glossary entry or type Option+\ and Option+Shift+\ to insert the characters. Note:  If you use the Insert Field Names list on the Print Merge Helper bar, Word inserts the print merge characters automatically.The number of fields in a data record does not match the number of field names in the header record.1.	Click the show/hide ¦ button on the ribbon to display paragraph marks.2.	Check the following:¥	That the correct data document name is specified in the DATA instruction in the main document.¥	If field names are in a separate header document, that there are the same number of fields in both the header record and the data document.¥	That the data record contains no merged or deleted cells.¥	That the data document does not contain any text or paragraph marks before or after the header record, between records, or after the last record.3.	If tabs or commas separate the fields, check that:¥	The same character (a tab or comma) separates fields in all records in the data document.¥	All records have the same number of fields and, therefore, the same number of tab or comma field separators. 	If a field in a record doesnÕt contain information, insert a tab or comma to indicate the empty field; for example:	name,company,address¦ 	Jean Sorell,,123 Main Street¦ ¥	Field text containing quotation marks, a tab, line break, paragraph mark, or comma (in fields separated by commas) is enclosed in quotation marks; for example:	ÒJean Sorrel, M.D.Ó,,123 Main Street¦ The INCLUDE document is too complex to merge.1.	Open the document that you specified in the INCLUDE instruction. 2.	Choose Save As from the File menu, clear Fast Save, and choose OK. 3.	Replace the existing document on the disk and try merging again.Word is out of memory.If Word is out of memory, you may get one of the following messages:	Too many editsNot enough disk spaceÉNot enough memory to complete operation÷	Try the following:¥	Merge a portion of the records by specifying a range in the From and To boxes in the Print Merge dialog box.¥	Leave only the main document open; close all other windows (including the data document).¥	Perform a normal save on the main document.	Choose Save As from the File menu, clear Fast Save, and choose OK. Then choose Yes to replace the existing document.¥	Save your documents and quit Word.  Shut down and then restart the Macintosh. In Finder, select the Word icon, choose Get Info from the File menu, and allocate more memory to Word. (2048K is recommended.) Then restart Word.¥	If you are using a System prior to version 7.0, in Finder, choose Control Panel from the  menu and turn off the RAM Cache. Then restart the Macintosh.Word is unable to open the data document or check it for errors.The name and/or location of the data document doesnÕt match the information in the DATA instruction in the main document. ÷	Specify the correct data document. (See ÒSpecifying a different data document,Ó later in this topic.)The left merge character (Ç) is missing ÷	Do both of the following:¥	Check that field names in the header record (or fields defined using ASK or SET) do not contain the words OR, AND, or NOT. For example, use payments_and_credits instead of payments and credits. ¥	Enclose the field names with print merge characters: ÇÈ 	Use the Print Merge glossary entry or type Option+\ and Option+Shift+\ to insert the characters. Note:  If you use the Insert Field Names list on the Print Merge Helper bar, Word inserts the print merge characters automatically.Word does not recognize a field name.This error is unlikely to occur if you insert field names using the Insert Field Name list on the Print Merge Helper bar.1.	In the main document, check that:¥	The field names in the main document match the names in the Insert Field Names list on the Print Merge Helper bar. 	Replace misspelled or incorrect fields with the appropriate fields from the list. (See ÒReplacing a field name in the main document,Ó later in this topic.)¥	There are no spaces between the field name and the print merge characters (ÇÈ).¥	Only one pair of print merge characters encloses the field name; for example, ÇnameÈ, not ÇÇnameÈÈ¥	The DATA instruction specifies the correct data document. (Make sure that the instruction doesnÕt specify the main document.)2.	In the data document, check that field names in the header record do not contain the words OR, AND, or NOT. For example, change payments and credits to payments_and_creditsø	Specifying a different data document1.	In the main document, if the Print Merge Helper bar is not displayed, choose Print Merge Helper from the View menu.2.	In the Insert Keyword list, choose DATA.3.	Word asks if you want to replace the existing DATA instruction. Choose Yes.4.	In the files list, select the data document and choose OK.	Word inserts a DATA instruction identifying the new data document. The Insert Field Name list on the Print Merge Helper bar lists the field names defined in the data documentÕs header record.ø	Replacing a field name in the main document1.	Make sure that the correct data document is specified in the DATA instruction in the main document.2.	In the main document, select the field name, including the print merge characters (ÇÈ).3.	In the Insert Field Name list on the Print Merge Helper bar, select the appropriate field name.4.	Make sure that only one pair of print merge characters (ÇÈ) encloses the field name.You can use the Microsoft Mail electronic mail program from within Word to send and receive documents as enclosures  to mail messages.

Line numbering is especially useful for legal documents and scripts.Line numbers are displayed only in print preview and when you print your document.Word numbers every line of text in the current section, including titles, headings, and empty paragraphs. If your document isnÕt divided into sections, Word numbers the entire document. Word does not number lines in footnotes, tables, headers, footers, or in text formatted as side-by-side paragraphs.You can prevent paragraphs within a numbered section from being numbered. For example, you can suppress numbering for headings and empty paragraphs.For more information on working with sections, see ÒFormatting: Section.Ó ø	Adding line numbers1.	If the document has only one section, place the insertion point on any page.	If the document has multiple sections, place the insertion point in the section whose lines you want to number.2.

Choose OK.You can number or renumber paragraphs with the Renumber command. The default numbering scheme is Arabic numerals followed by a period and a tab. You can specify a different format. You can also adjust the tab stop locations as you would for any tab stop in Word.When numbering documents, Word treats paragraphs with different heading styles or with different indents as paragraphs of different levels. Word does not recognize indents created with tabs and spaces as having different levels. If all selected paragraphs have the same indent level, Word numbers them sequentially with no subordinate numbering levels.Word does not number empty paragraphs.In outline view, if a selection begins with a heading style, Word numbers all uncollapsed headings in the selection. If a selection begins with a regular paragraph, Word numbers all uncollapsed paragraphs in the selection, regardless of their style.Note:  Dialog box options for the Renumber command are listed at the end of this topic.Tip:  The fastest way to number paragraphs is to create paragraphs that have the heading levels, indentations, and numbering scheme you want. Include separation characters, for example 1. or 1) followed by a tab. Select the example paragraphs and all other paragraphs you want to number and choose Renumber from the Tools menu. By Example is selected for you; choose OK.ø	Numbering paragraphs1.	Select the paragraphs you want to number.	If you donÕt make a selection, Word numbers the entire document.2.	From the Tools menu, choose Renumber.3.	To start numbering with a number other than 1, type that number in the Start At box.4.	In the Format box, specify a format. Separate the numbers or letters with a period or other separator character. You can use any of the following:Type	For1	Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3)I	Uppercase Roman numerals (I, II, III)i	Lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii)A	Uppercase letters (A, B, C)a	Lowercase letters (a, b, c)Separator Characters.	Period, 	Comma-	Hyphen/	Slash;	Semicolon: 	Colon()	Left and right parentheses[]	Left and right brackets{}	Left and right braces	For example, to number paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and so on, type (1) in the Format box.	If you have multiple levels and want standard outline numbering, type I.A.1.a.i.	To use a space instead of a tab, type a space after the last number or separator.5.	Next to Numbers, select a numbering option:Select	For this numbering scheme1	One number or letter assigned to each 	paragraph (use when all paragraphs 	have the same level)1.1	Two or more numbers or letters 	assigned to each paragraph (use when 	paragraphs have different levels)6.	Choose OK.ø	Renumbering paragraphs1.	If you want to include paragraphs that arenÕt already numbered, at the beginning of each unnumbered paragraph, type any number followed by a tab.	Use any formatting scheme described in the procedure, ÒNumbering paragraphs,Ó in this topic.2.	Select the paragraphs you want to renumber.	You can include paragraphs you donÕt want to number in your selection; if they arenÕt numbered Word will ignore them.3.	From the Tools menu, choose Renumber.4.	Select Only If Already Numbered.5.	In the Start At box, type the starting number you want.	Word chooses the format of the first number in the selection and automatically selects By Example.6.	Choose OK.ø	Removing paragraph numbers1.	Select the paragraphs from which you want to remove numbers.	If no paragraphs are selected, Word removes numbers from all numbered paragraphs.2.	From the Tools menu, choose Renumber.3.	Next to Numbers, select Remove.4.	Choose OK.Renumber command options (Tools menu)Paragraphs Specifies the paragraphs you want to number.	All Numbers or renumbers all paragraphs in the document or in a selection. In outline view, numbers only the expanded headings.	Only If Already Numbered Renumbers paragraphs in a document or in a selection.Start At Specifies the starting number for the first paragraph in a selection. If the selection is not numbered, Word proposes 1. Otherwise, Word proposes the number of the first paragraph in the selection.Format Specifies the number format and separator characters for the paragraph numbers.	If you donÕt type a format, Word uses Arabic numerals separated by periods for all levels. If the selection is already numbered, Word proposes the format of the first number in the selection and automatically selects By Example.Numbers These options, along with the format in the Format box, control the numbering scheme.	1	Shows one number or letter for each level:	1	2		1			1			2	1.1	Shows all numbers or letters in sequence for each level:	1	2		2.1			2.1.1			2.1.2	By Example	Uses a 1 or 1.1 numbering scheme, based on the number shown in the first paragraph at each level. If you have different formats for different levels, Word retains the formatting for each level.	Remove	Removes all numbers and tabs following the numbers in the document or selection. If you select Remove, Start At and Format are not available.OK Accepts the settings and closes the dialog box.Cancel Cancels the command.In Word, an outline is one of four ways of viewing and working with a document. Outline view shows the structure of your documents and lets you quickly rearrange large amounts of text.In outline view, paragraphs are either headings or body text. Headings  have one of nine automatic styles, Heading 1 through Heading 9. Body text  is any text that does not have a heading style.In outline view, you can:¥	Hide, or collapse, the document to show only the headings or expand  the collapsed headings to display all subheadings and body text. Collapsing lets you focus on the documentÕs organization and expanding lets you work on the entire document. You can also display only the first line of body text under a heading.¥	Demote a heading to a lower level, or promote  it to a higher level. Word indents paragraphs to show their assigned levels.¥	Move headings or body text up or down in the outline. If you move a heading, all subheadings and body text below it move with the heading.¥	Display or hide character formats.In outline view, Word displays an outline bar at the top of the document.

When you create a full page of text or graphics, Word inserts an automatic page break. In normal view, an automatic page break is displayed as a dotted horizontal line. As you edit and reformat, Word adjusts page breaks automatically. You cannot delete automatic page breaks, but you can prevent unwanted breaks within a paragraph or between paragraphs by using the Pagination options in the Paragraph dialog box.If you want to force a page break at a particular location, you can insert a manual page break. A manual page break is displayed in normal view as two dotted horizontal lines with tightly spaced dots. When you insert a manual page break, Word adjusts the automatic page breaks that follow. Word cannot move manual page breaks.Word repaginates  (adjusts page breaks) when you print, preview, compile an index or table of contents, or choose the Repaginate Now command. Word also repaginates automatically as you work. If you donÕt want Word to repaginate automatically, clear the Background Repagination option in the General category of the Preferences dialog box. (See ÒCustomizing your work environment.Ó)ø	Viewing page breaks÷	Do one of the following:¥	Scroll through the document and look at the page breaks.¥	From the View menu, choose Page Layout.	The page containing the insertion point is displayed as it will print.

You can import graphics created in other programs and saved in PICT, PICT2, TIFF, or EPS format. You can also convert existing text to a graphic.Word encloses each graphic in a graphic frame, which has small black boxes called handles  that you use to scale and crop the graphic. Scaling changes the size of a graphic element. Cropping trims portions of a graphic or adds trimmed portions back to the graphic but doesnÕt change the graphicÕs original size.You can insert empty graphic frames as placeholders and create or import a graphic later. Empty frames appear as dotted lines when you choose Show ¦ from the View menu.Note:  Dialog box options for the Picture command are listed at the end of this topic.For more information on using the tools in the Picture window and importing EPS graphics and PostScript code, see ÒCreating and Importing Graphics,Ó in the Microsoft Word UserÕs Guide.For related information, see ÒPositioning text and graphics on a pageÓ and ÒDocuments: Converting.ÓNote:  The Picture command is installed automatically if you used installed Word using Easy Install.

A frame lets you position items anywhere on the page and acts as an invisible box around which regular text will flow. In print preview, you can move a framed item by dragging it.Word has two Frame commands:¥	The Frame command on the Insert  menu automatically frames a fixed-width selection, such as a graphic or table, and displays it in print preview so you can drag it to a new location. You can also use this Frame command to insert a blank frame.¥	The Frame command on the Format  menu specifies the width and position of a frame before you insert it. With this command, you can align frames horizontally and vertically relative to the margins, column boundaries, and edges of the page. You can also remove items from a frame and restore their original positions.Note:  Dialog box options for the Frame command on the Format menu are listed at the end of this topic. The Frame command on the Insert menu does not display a dialog box.For more information on working with frames, see ÒPositioning Text and Graphics on the PageÓ in the Microsoft Word UserÕs Guide.You set text alignment, indents, and spacing within a frame as you do for a normal paragraph. For more information, see ÒFormatting: Paragraph.Óø	Positioning a graphic, table, or other fixed width item1.	Select the item you want to position.	If the item is part of a paragraph, Word places the item in a separate paragraph.	If there is no selection, Word creates a new paragraph in an empty frame.2.	From the Insert menu, choose Frame.	Word frames the selection and displays the current page in print preview. 	If there is at least 1 inch of space (plus the measurement specified in the From Text box in the Frame dialog box) between the frame and the edge of another text element (for example, a column boundary or margin), other text in the document flows around the frame.3.	Drag the frame to adjust its position.	The top of the window displays the location of the top left corner of the frame relative to the edges of the page.	When you release the mouse button, Word displays the new position of the frame relative to the other items on the page. Readjust the position as desired.4.	Choose Close.	To see the position of the framed item on the page, choose Print Preview (File menu) or Page Layout (View menu).ø	Specifying the frame width, spacing, or position for text or an item1.	Select the paragraph(s) or item to position.	If you select only part of a paragraph, Word frames the entire paragraph. 	If there is no selection, Word frames the paragraph that contains the insertion point.	To adjust an existing frame, select all the paragraphs in the frame. If there is only one paragraph, position the insertion point in the frame.2.	From the Format menu, choose Frame.3.	In the Frame dialog box, do any or all of the following:Under	Do thisHorizontal	Select or type a measurement. In 	Relative To, select the part of the 	page to use as a reference. The frame 	is positioned the specified distance 	from the left edge of the page, 	margin, or column boundary.Vertical	Select or type a measurement. In 	Relative To, select the part of the 	page to use as a reference. The frame 	is positioned the specified distance 	from the top edge of the page or 	margin.Frame Width	If the selection includes text, type a 	width for the frame. Choose Auto to 	automatically extend the frame from 	margin to margin or the width of a 	column.	To automatically position a graphic, 	table, or other fixed-width item and 	adjust the frame width to fit the 	item, choose Auto.From Text	Type a measurement to set the 	minimum space Word maintains 	between the frame and adjacent text.4.	Do one of the following:¥	Choose OK to accept the position of the frame.¥	Choose Position to display the frame in print preview, adjust the position by dragging, and then choose Close.ø	Restoring framed items to their original positions1.	Select the items in the frame.	To restore all the items in a frame, include the entire frame in the selection.2.	From the Format menu, choose Frame.3.	Choose Unframe.4.	Choose OK.	Word removes the items from the frame and restores them to their original locations.Tips¥	If you position a frame near the edge of a page, part of the framed item may not print because of the minimum margin required by your printer. Reposition, indent, or add a space before or after the frame.¥	Positioning a frame anchors it to a particular location on a page, but not to a particular page. If you add or delete text, the frame may shift to another page, where it will retain its assigned position.¥	To see the location of the frame and adjust its position, use print preview. To get a close view of the frame in relation to surrounding text, use page layout view. If it is not important to see the location of the item, use normal view for quicker editing.¥	The position you assign to a frame can be defined as a style and used throughout your documents. (See ÒStyles: Creating and modifying styles.Ó)Frame command options (Format menu)Horizontal Positions the frame horizontally relative to the page reference you select. Type a fixed distance or select a position.	Left Aligns the left edge of the frame with the left margin, side of the column, or edge of the page.	Center Centers the frame between the left and right margins, column boundaries, or page edges.	Right Aligns the right edge of the frame with the right margin, side of the column, or edge of the page.Inside On odd-numbered pages, the same as selecting Left; on even-numbered pages, the same as selecting Right.Outside On odd-numbered pages, the same as selecting Right; on even-numbered pages, the same as selecting Left.Relative To Specifies the page area used as the horizontal reference for positioning the frame.	Margin	Positions the frame within the main text area relative to one or both margins.	Page	Positions the frame within the left or right margin area, or centers it between the left and right edges of the page.

The battery power indicator appears only when you install Word on a PowerBook.When your PowerBook battery is fully charged, the battery power indicator is entirely filled in. As you use your PowerBook and the battery begins to lose power, the level of black in the battery power indicator drops.When the level of black in the battery power indicator is very low, the PowerBook will dim the screen and display a message indicating that itÕs time to recharge the battery. You should save your work at this time and recharge the battery.An empty battery power indicator means that your PowerBook battery is almost out of power. If you have a PowerBook 140 or 170, you may have just enough time to save your document before the PowerBook shuts down. If you have a PowerBook 100, you may still be able to work for a few minutes, but itÕs best to save your work and recharge the battery as soon as possible.You can preview your document before you print using the Page Layout and Print Preview commands. In both views, headers, footers, footnotes, newspaper-style columns, graphics, and text are displayed in their actual positions on the page.Note:  Dialog box options for the Print Preview command are listed at the end of this topic. Page Layout does not display a dialog box.For more information on the different views in Word, see ÒDocuments: Viewing.ÓPage layout viewPage layout view lets you view and edit the document before you print. Text and graphics appear true to size and in their exact positions. Line numbers are the only page element not visible in page layout view.In page layout view, you can view one page at a time. If you continue to type or scroll when you reach the bottom of a page, Word changes the display to show the top of the next page. For information on moving the insertion point and scrolling in page layout view, see ÒMoving through a document.Óø	Viewing a document in page layout view÷	From the View menu, choose Page Layout.	To quit using Page Layout view, choose another view from the View menu.Note:  In page layout view, if you choose the Footnote command or any of the header or footer commands from the View menu, Word moves the insertion point to the appropriate text area on the page instead of opening a separate window.ø	Displaying text boundaries in page layout viewEach page elementÑfor example, a footer or text columnÑis contained in a separate text area.÷	To see the text areas, do one of the following:¥	To view text boundaries all the time, select the Text Boundaries In Page Layout View option in the View category of the Preferences dialog box (Tools menu).¥	To view text boundaries only when Word displays special characters, choose the show/hide ¦ button on the ribbon.Print previewPrint preview displays one or two complete pages at a reduced size.

This inserts brackets around the information and creates a file, called an edition, which contains a copy of the information. If you change the information in the publisher, Word updates the information in the edition. You can store an edition on a floppy disk, a hard disk, or a network server.To access the information in the edition, other users insert a subscriber  in a Word document or in a document in another application that supports publish and subscribe. Changing the information in the publisher updates the information in the edition, which in turn updates the information in the subscriber.You can use the Publisher Options and Subscriber Options commands to specify how frequently Word updates the edition and subscribers. If you do not change the frequency, Word updates automatically. If you want to stop updating, you can cancel the publisher or subscriber.Note:  Dialog box options for the following commands are listed at the end of this topic: Create Publisher, Publisher Options, Subscribe To, and Subscriber Options.Tip:  With System 7, you can share information among Word documents and with other applications.If you want to update information regularly:¥	To share information between several applications or machines, use publish and subscribe.¥	To update within one document or between applications on one machine, use linking.If you want to include information from other applications in only one Word document, use embedding.ø	Creating a publisher1.

When you want to make changes to textÑedit it, reformat it, move it, or delete itÑyou must first select that text.Word highlights selected textÑit appears with a different colored background than text in the rest of the document. The background color depends on your computer and monitor.For information on selecting in tables, see ÒTables: Selecting and moving in tables.ÓFor information on moving the insertion point, see ÒMoving through a document.ÓFor information on using the keyboard and mouse, see Appendix C, ÒKeyboard and Mouse Shortcuts,Ó in the Microsoft Word UserÕs Guide.ø	Selecting with the mouseYou can quickly select units of text and graphics by clicking in the selection bar, an invisible strip along the left side of the document window.

You can sort paragraphs, tables, and lists created with tabs alphabetically or numerically. If you are using print merge, you can also sort to change the order of data records. You can sort in any view except print preview.Word sorts text based on the letter or number of the leftmost character in each paragraph of a selection. You can choose to sort in ascending (0-9 and A-Z) or descending (9-0 and Z-A) order.If the selection contains only numbers, they are sorted numerically. If the selection contains letters and numbers, they are sorted alphanumerically. Word sorts punctuation and special symbols (such as ! and &) first, then numbers, and then letters.  Uppercase letters are sorted before lowercase letters. If a sort does not produce the desired results, you can undo the sort by choosing Undo immediately after performing the sort.To avoid unintentional changes, save your document before performing a sort. If necessary, after an unsuccessful sort, you can close the document without saving it and reopen it in its presorted form.ø	Sorting paragraphsUse this procedure to sort numbered paragraphs or lists of words and phrases. To rearrange unnumbered paragraphs, use the outlining or drag-and-drop feature. 1.	Select the paragraphs you want to sort.2.	Do one of the following:¥	To sort in ascending order (0-9, A-Z), choose Sort from the Tools menu.¥	To sort in descending order (9-0, Z-A), hold down the Shift key and choose the Sort Descending command from the Tools menu.Note:  If you sort an entire document that contains tables, Word treats the table as one unit and places the table within the document based on the contents of the first cell in the table.ø	Sorting tables÷	Select the column(s) you want to sort by and follow the procedure, ÒSorting paragraphs,Ó earlier in this topic.When you sort a table, rows are sorted based on the column(s) you select. If you select one column, the sort is based on that column.If you select more than one column, the rows are sorted based on the contents of the cells in the leftmost column in the selection. If any cells in the first column have the same value, Word bases the rest of the sort on the second column, and then on any additional columns until the sort is complete.  Note:  Sorting a list created with tabs is similar to sorting a table. To sort rows based on the contents of the first column, select all the paragraphs you want to sort. To sort rows based on a column other than the first, hold down the Option key and drag over the column on which you want to base the sort.Tips¥	If you need to sort only the contents of one column but leave the rest of the table intact, copy the column to another location, sort it, and paste the sorted column in the table.¥	When you sort bordered cells, the borders remain with the cells. You may need to reformat the cells after sorting.¥	To avoid sorting table headings, don't include them in a selection.ø	Reversing a sort÷	Immediately after you sort, choose the Undo command from the Edit menu.There are two types of special characters in Word:¥	Nonprinting characters, such as tabs and end-of-cell marks, paragraph marks, and spaces.¥	Bullets and symbols, such as ¨, ·, and °, that are included in the fonts installed in your system.You can move, copy, delete, and search for nonprinting characters as you would any characters. For information on finding and replacing nonprinting characters, see ÒFinding and replacing text.ÓYou can display or hide nonprinting characters on the screen. These characters do not print. Bullets and other symbols, which you insert using the Symbol command, display and print in your documents.ø	Displaying and hiding ¦ marks and other nonprinting characters÷	Do one of the following:¥	On the ribbon, choose the show/hide ¦ button:G¥	From the View menu, choose Show ¦.If you are using System 7, the brackets enclosing links, publishers, and subscribers, and the borders enclosing embedded objects are also displayed when you display nonprinting characters.ø	Typing nonprinting charactersThe following table shows the keys to press to create nonprinting characters.Character	Shown as	PressParagraph mark	¦	Return or EnterNewline character	ù	Shift+ReturnTab character	ú	TabNormal space	. (dot)	SpacebarNonbreaking space	ý	Option+SpacebarNonbreaking hyphen	ü	+~ (tilde)Optional hyphen	û	+- (hyphen)Formula character	þ	+Option+\		(backslash)End-of-cell mark	¥	AutomaticParagraph	Z	Automaticproperties markA formula character is displayed when you insert a formula-typesetting command. An end-of-cell mark is automatically displayed in every cell and after the last cell in a row. (After the last cell, it is called an end-of-row mark.) A paragraph properties mark is displayed next to positioned paragraphs or paragraphs that contain page layouts that Word cannot represent visually in the current viewÑnext to paragraphs formatted as Òkeep together,Ó for example.ø	Adding bullets to an existing list with the Bulleted List button1.	Select the paragraphs to which you want to add bullets.2.	On the Toolbar, click the Bulleted List button.ø	Adding a bullet to the current paragraph with the Bulleted List button1.	Position the insertion point in the paragraph to which you want to add a bullet.2.	On the Toolbar, click the Bulleted List button.Word inserts a bullet and formats the current paragraph with a hanging indent, unless the paragraph is already formatted with a hanging indent. The Bulleted List button inserts a bullet of the same font and size as the first character of the paragraph.ø	Inserting a special character with the Symbol command1.	Position the insertion point where you want to insert the special character.2.	From the Insert menu, choose Symbol.	The dialog box displays the characters for the active font.3.	If you want to view characters in a different font or point size, choose a font or size from the Font menu.4.	Click the character(s) in the Symbol dialog box that you want to insert.5.	Click the close box.Characters you type following the insertion point will have the font and size of the last character you inserted. If you want a different font and size, choose them from the Font menu. If you want to return to the paragraphÕs original font and size, choose Revert To Style (Format menu).The Spelling command checks part or all of your document for spelling errors and suggests possible corrections. Word checks all text, including text in headers, footers, and footnotes.If Word finds a word it does not recognize, you can:¥	View a list of suggested spellings.¥	Change this occurrence or all occurrences of the word.¥	Ignore this occurrence or all occurrences of the word.¥	Add the word to a custom dictionary. Word uses custom dictionaries to store specialized terms, acronyms, names, and abbreviations and does not question them during a spelling check.Note:  Before you can check hidden text, you must display it on the screen. To display hidden text, select the Hidden Text option in the View category of the Preferences dialog box (Tools menu). With the Preferences command, you can specify that Word use a particular main dictionary; create, open, close, and edit custom dictionaries; and specify types of words you want Word to ignore.Note:  Dialog box options for the Spelling command are listed at the end of this topic.ø	Checking spellingWord checks text beginning at the insertion point or at the first word in a selection.

You name the collection of formats and then apply the style name to all the paragraphs you want to have the same formats. With styles, you can apply many formats at once and change formats quickly for all paragraphs having that style.Each new document includes a default style sheet. A style sheet is a collection of styles defined for a document, including standard Word styles and styles you create.Standard styles  are predefined styles (such as Heading 1, Index 2, and Footer) inserted by Word when you create document elements such as outlines, indexes, and footers. Word indicates standard styles with a bullet (¥) in the Styles dialog box.Normal style  is the standard style applied to all paragraphs until you apply a different style. Normal style includes the default font and point size that you chose when you installed Word.You can redefine the standard styles or create and redefine your own styles using the ruler or the Style command. You also can copy a single style or an entire style sheet to another document and print a style sheet for reference.Note:  Dialog box options for the Style command are listed at the end this topic.For more information, see ÒStyles: Applying styles,Ó ÒFormatting: Character,Ó and ÒFormatting: Paragraph.Óø	Creating a style using the rulerThis procedure creates a style based on the formats of a selected paragraph.

If the dialog box was displayed after you chose Save or Save As, Cancel also saves the document.You create a table of contents or other list, such as a list of illustrations, in two basic steps. First designate text as a table of contents entry, and then use the Table of Contents command to compile the table of contents or list.You can designate text as a table of contents entry using either heading styles or codes. Heading styles are generally faster to use, but codes provide more options.When you compile the table of contents or list, you specify which levels of heading style or codes you want to include. To create sublevels in the table of contents, or to create multiple lists, use different levels of headings or codes for each sublevel or list. You can designate up to nine different levels of both headings and codes.When you compile a table of contents or list, Word repaginates the document and inserts the table of contents or list at the beginning of the document, followed by a section break.Word indents sublevels and formats lists based on the automatic table of contents styles (TOC 1 through TOC 9). You can change the default formatting by redefining the table of contents styles. (See ÒStyles: Creating and modifying styles.Ó)You can compile a table of contents and multiple lists for a document or for a series of connected documents. For more information on including multiple lists in one document, see Chapter 30, ÒIndexes and Tables of Contents,Ó in the Microsoft Word UserÕs Guide.  To create a series of documents, see ÒDocuments: Connecting in a series.ÓNote:  Dialog box options for the Table Of Contents command are listed at the end of this topic.ø	Designating a table of contents entry using heading styles1.	Select a paragraph that you want to be a table of contents entry.2.	In the styles box on the left end of the ruler, select the appropriate heading level for the paragraph. For example, for a first-level heading, select Heading 1.	If you donÕt see a heading style in the box, hold down Shift and select the style in the list.Note:  If you create another list in addition to a table of contents, such as a list of illustrations, choose distinct heading styles for each list so that the two do not compile as one list.ø	Designating a table of contents entry using codes1.	Select text that you want to be a table of contents entry.2.	From the Insert menu, choose TOC Entry.	Word inserts a contents code (.c.) in front of the selected text and an end-of-entry code (;) after the selected text, and formats the codes as hidden text. If the entry comes immediately before a paragraph mark, Word doesnÕt include the end-of-entry code.	To display hidden codes, select the Hidden Text option in the View category of the Preferences dialog box (Tools menu).To create sublevels in the table of contents, type a number from 1 through 9 in the contents code (immediately before the second period). For example, use .c2. for a second-level entry. Word automatically indents sublevels in the table of contents, based on the table of contents styles.Note:  A semicolon indicates the end of a table of contents entry and a colon indicates a subentry. To include these characters as part of a table of contents entry, surround the text including the semicolon or colon with single quotation marks formatted as hidden text. For example, .c.'Catalog;list:';ø	Compiling a table of contents1.	Designate text as table of contents entries by using heading styles or inserting codes with the TOC Entry command.2.	From the Insert menu, choose Table Of Contents.3.	Under Collect, do one of the following:¥	To compile a table of contents using heading styles, select Outline.¥	To compile a table of contents using codes, select .C. Paragraphs.4.	If you donÕt want to include page numbers, clear Show Page Numbers.5.	Next to Level, do one of the following:¥	To create a table of contents using all available headings or .c. levels, select All.¥	To create a table of contents using a subset of available headings or .c. levels, select From.	In the From box, type a number for the largest level you want in the table of contents; in the To box, type a number for the smallest level. For example, to collect levels 3 through 5, type 3 in the From box and 5 in the To box.	To collect only one level, type the number of that level in both boxes.6.	Choose Start.7.	To collect more than one list, repeat steps 2 through 6 for each list, choosing No when Word asks if you want to replace the table of contents.Note:  If you are using heading levels as table of contents entries, do not format them as hidden text. If you are using .c. codes, make sure the codes, and text (if appropriate) are formatted as hidden text.Table Of Contents command options(Insert menu)Collect Specifies whether Word uses heading styles or coded paragraphs to compile the table of contents or other list.	Outline Compiles a table of contents or list from heading styles.	.C. Paragraphs Compiles a table of contents or list from codes.Show Page Numbers Controls whether or not page numbers are included in the table of contents or list.Level Specifies the level of heading styles or coded entries to include in the table of contents or list.	All Includes all levels of heading styles or .c. paragraphs.	From, To Includes only the levels of headings or .c. paragraphs you specify. To include only one level, type the same number in both boxes.Start Compiles the table of contents or other list.Cancel Cancels the command.Arranging text in columns by creating a table is much easier than setting up columns with tabs.In Word, tables consist of rows and columns divided into rectangular areas called cells, which you can fill with text and graphics. Text wraps within each cell, so you can edit without disturbing the layout of the columns.You can insert an empty table with the the Table button on the ribbon or the Table command on the Insert menu. You can fill the table with text and graphics, or you can convert existing text into a table.For information on converting a table back into text, see ÒTables: Converting a table to text.ÓAn end-of-cell mark stores the formatting for each cell and indicates the end of the cell. An end-of-row mark indicates the end of a row. To display end-of-cell and end-of-row marks, choose the show/hide ¦ button on the ribbon.To make it easy for you to view cell boundaries, Word displays table gridlines by default. If you donÕt want to see them, clear the Table Gridlines option in the View category of the Preferences dialog box. (See ÒCustomizing your work environment.Ó)Note:  Dialog box options for the Table and Text To Table commands are listed at the end of this topic.ø	Inserting an empty table using the Table buttonYou can also use the Table command to insert a table.1.	Position the insertion point where you want to insert the table.2.	On the ribbon, click and hold down the Table button.3.	On the Table button grid, drag the mouse to select the number of columns and rows you want the new table to have.	Word indicates the number of columns and rows you select at the bottom of the grid. For example, if you select 2 rows and 3 columns, Ò2 x 3 TableÓ appears at the bottom of the grid.4.	To insert the table, release the mouse button.ø	 Converting text to a table using the Table buttonYou can also use the Text To Table command to convert text to a table.1.	Select the lines of text or the paragraphs you want to convert to a table.2.	On the ribbon, click the Table button.	Word displays a dialog box listing various conversion options.3.	Select the conversion options you want.4.	Choose the OK button.Tips¥	To add columns in an existing table, use the Table button or the Table Layout command. To delete columns, use the Table Layout command.¥	To add a row at the end of a table, position the insertion point in the last cell or at the end of the last row and press Tab.¥	To change the width of columns or cells in an existing table, select the cells or columns, click the table scale button on the ruler (@), and drag the C markers to the positions you want, or use the Table Cells command.¥	To insert a tab in a table, press Option+Tab instead of the Tab key.¥	To insert an empty paragraph above a table, position the insertion point in the upper-left cell of the table and press +Option+Spacebar.¥	To split a table and insert an empty paragraph, position the insertion point in the row where you want to break the table and press +Option+Spacebar.Table and Text To Table command options (Insert menu)Number Of Columns Specifies the initial number of columns for the table.Number Of Rows Specifies the initial number of rows for the table.Column Width Specifies the width of all columns in the table.Convert From Controls how Word distributes text in table cells by specifying which character or format signals the beginning of a new cell. If you select text to convert to a table, Word proposes an option based on the character or format of the selection.	Paragraphs Specifies that a paragraph mark signals the beginning of a new cell.	Word proposes one column and as many rows as paragraphs you selected. If you change the number of columns, Word adjusts the number of rows. For example, if you select nine paragraphs and specify three columns, Word changes the rows to three.	Tab Delimited Specifies that a tab character signals the beginning of a new cell.	Word bases the number of columns on the greatest number of tabs in any one paragraph or line. Each paragraph or line of text ending in a newline character (ù) is converted to a separate row.	Comma Delimited Specifies that a comma signals the beginning of a new cell.	Word bases the number of columns on the greatest number of commas in any one paragraph or line. Each paragraph or line of text ending in a newline character (ù) is converted to a separate row.	Side By Side Only Converts text formatted as side-by-side paragraphs into a table with the same number of columns as paragraphs.OK Creates a table based on the specified options.Cancel Cancels the command.Format Creates a table based on the options you specify and opens the Table Cells dialog box, from which you can format the table.You select text and move within a single table cell using the mouse or arrow keys just as you do in regular paragraphs. If you continue to press an arrow key after you reach the end of the current cell, you move to an adjacent cell.Columns and cells have invisible selection bars. The column selection bar runs along the top of each column. The cell selection bar runs along the left side of each cell. You can use the selection bars to select columns and cells.When the mouse pointer enters the column selection bar, or if you hold down the Option key while the mouse pointer is over a table, the pointer becomes a down-pointing arrow. When the mouse pointer enters a cell selection bar, it becomes a diagonally pointing arrow.To select	Do thisA cell	Click the cell selection bar or 	position the insertion point 	anywhere in the cellContents of a cell	Click the cell selection barContents of the 	Press Tabnext cellContents of the	Press Shift+Tabprevious cellEntire row	Double-click the cell selection 	barEntire column	Click the column selection bar or 	hold down the Option key and 	click in the columnEntire table	Hold down the Option key and 	double-click in the tableFor additional techniques for moving between cells, see ÒMoving through a document.ÓYou can change the structure of a table by adding or deleting table cells, rows, and columns. You can also combine (merge) cells to span several columns, or split merged cells into their constituent parts.You can insert an empty paragraph above a table, or insert an empty paragraph to split a table into two tables.Note:  Dialog box options for the Table Layout command are listed at the end of this topic.ø	Adding cells, columns, or rows using the Table button1.

Position the insertion point in the last cell of the last row or at the end of the last row.2.	Press the Tab key.ø	Deleting rows and columns1.	Select the rows or columns you want to delete.2.	From the Format menu, choose Table Layout.3.	Select Row, Column, or Selection.4.	Choose Delete.ø	Merging multiple cells into one cellYou can merge cells horizontally, but not vertically. Use merging, for example, to create a heading that spans several columns. You cannot merge a previously merged cell with other cells.1.	Select the cells that you want to merge by clicking the selection bar of one cell and dragging to the next cell(s).2.	From the Format menu, choose Table Layout.3.	Choose Merge Cells.ø	Splitting cells that were previously mergedYou can split a merged cell back into its constituent cells, but you cannot split cells that have not been merged.1.	Select a cell that was previously merged from two or more cells.2.	From the Format menu, choose Table Layout.3.	Choose Split Cell.	If Split Cell is not available, the selected cell was not previously merged.ø	Inserting an empty paragraph above a table or splitting a table1.	Do one of the following:¥	To insert an empty paragraph above a table, position the insertion point in the top row of the table.¥	To split a table and insert an empty paragraph, position the insertion point in the row above which you want to insert the paragraph.2.	Press +Option+Spacebar.Note:  To delete a paragraph mark inserted using +Option+Spacebar, choose Cut from the Edit menu or press +X. You canÕt use the Delete key. Table Layout command options (Format menu)Row Inserts or deletes one or more rows based on the size of the selection.Column Inserts or deletes one or more columns based on the size of the selection.Selection Inserts new cells based on the number of cells currently selected, or deletes the selected area. If you select this option, you must select an option under Shift Cells.Shift Cells Specifies the direction that adjacent cells move when you insert or delete cells. Available only when you select the Selection option.	Horizontally Adds new cells to the left of the selection.	Vertically Adds new cells above the selection.Insert Inserts rows, columns, or cells based on the selection. New rows are inserted above the selected row(s) or the row containing the insertion point.Delete Deletes selected rows, columns, or cells.Merge Cells Combines the contents of two or more selected cells in the same row to create one cell that spans multiple columns. Text within the selected cells forms individual paragraphs in the new cell. If you select a merged cell, Merge Cells changes to Split Cell.Split Cell Separates a previously merged cell into individual cells. If you select multiple cells in one row, Split Cell changes to Merge Cells, unless a cell in the selection was previously merged.Cancel Cancels the command.To move and copy text and graphics within cells, select the text and use the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands, just as you would for text and graphics outside a table.However, if you select entire cells (including their end-of-cell marks), choosing the Cut or Copy command cuts or copies both the contents and the cells themselves. You can then paste the cells into an existing table, or to the right or bottom of a table.For more information, see ÒCopying and moving text and graphics.Óø	Copying or moving cells1.	Select the cells you want to copy or move.2.	From the Edit menu, choose Copy or Cut.	If you select end-of-cell marks, Word cuts or copies the cells and their contents. If you choose Cut, empty cells remain in the table.3.	To determine the location for the cells and/or cell contents, do one of the following:¥	Position the insertion point in the upper-left cell of the area where you want to paste.¥	Select an area in a table that exactly matches the number and arrangement of cells you cut or copied.¥	To add cells to the right of a row, position the insertion point in front the end-of-row mark.¥	To add cells to the bottom of a table, position the insertion point in front of the paragraph mark below the table.¥	To place a table within text, position the insertion point where you want to insert the table.4.	From the Edit menu, choose Paste Cells.	If there is a selection in the table, Paste Cells replaces the contents of the selection. If the copied text includes an end-of-cell mark, Paste Cells replaces the contents of the cell even if the cell is not selected. If the number of cut or copied cells is greater than the number of empty cells, the text in the existing cells is overwritten.With the Table Cells command, you can change the appearance of a table in several ways. You can:¥	Change the width of selected cells and entire columns.¥	Set minimum or fixed heights for each row.¥	Indent whole rows from the left margin.¥	Align the table with respect to the page margins.¥	Add a border or shading for the table cells.For information on adding borders and shading to cells, see ÒBorders and Shading.ÓTip:  If you need to change the width of columns in a table or the left margin indent, itÕs easiest to use the ruler. (See ÒRuler.Ó)Note:  Dialog box options for the Table Cells command are listed at the end of this topic.ø	Changing row heightFixed row heights are especially useful in forms.1.	Select the rows you want to adjust.2.	From the Format menu, choose Table Cells.3.	In the Height box under Row, select one of the following:Select	ToAuto	Adjust row height automatically to 	accommodate any text or graphics in 	any cell in the row, up to the height of	the page.At Least	Set a minimum row height of the size 	you specify in the text box. Word can 	adjust the height to accommodate 	larger text or graphics.Exactly	Set a fixed row height of the size you 	specify in the text box. If text or 	graphics in a cell exceed the fixed 	height, that material is cut off when 	you print.4.	If you chose At Least or Exactly, type a measurement in inches (in), points (pt), or centimeters (cm) in the Height box under Row.5.	Choose OK.ø	Aligning or indenting rows1.
