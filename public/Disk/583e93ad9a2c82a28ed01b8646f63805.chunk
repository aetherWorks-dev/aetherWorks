taller places a copy of ATM 4.0 in the Adobe Acrobat 3.0 / Fonts folder. This private copy of ATM is recognized and used only by Acrobat Reader 3.0 and uses memory only when Acrobat Reader is running.Based on whether QuickDraw GX is enabled or not at the time of installation, different versions of the Adobe Acrobat substitution fonts Adobe Sans MM and Adobe Serif MM (and perhaps other Type 1 fonts) are installed. Later, if QuickDraw GX is either enabled or disabled, you will need to re-install Acrobat Reader 3.0.If you install System 7.5 and QuickDraw GX after installing Acrobat 3.0, you will need to re-install Acrobat Reader 3.0. The QuickDraw GX 1.0 installer replaces ATM 4.0 with ATM GX (ATM 3.7), which is not compatible with Acrobat Reader 3.0.If TrueType versions of Symbol or Zapf Dingbats are installed on your system they are not replaced nor moved. If you are using Type 1 versions of these fonts, updated versions of the Type 1 fonts Symbol and Zapf Dingbats will be installed in the appropriate location for your version of System 7.Acrobat Reader Memory Requirements - Memory requirements settings for Acrobat Reader 3.0 can be set by selecting the Acrobat Reader 3.0 icon in the Finder and choosing Get Info from the File menu. In the Memory Requirements section of the dialog, the "factory" default for Minimum size is set to 3300 K (5227 K for PowerMac with Virtual Memory turned off) and should not be changed. The Preferred memory size is 4500 K  (6427 K for PowerMac with Virtual Memory turned off) and may be adjusted as described below.If you are using ATM in the Adobe Acrobat 3.0 / Fonts folder, it allocates approximately 1000 K of RAM (800K of RAM for 680x0 processors) out of the Acrobat Reader 3.0 partition. On a Macintosh with a 680x0 processor, if there is not sufficient space or if Virtual Memory is on, ATM attempts to allocate RAM from System memory.If you are using system-level ATM on a 680x0-based (non-PowerMac) system you can reduce the Preferred size value for Acrobat Reader 3.0 by 800K.If you are using Acrobat Search, you should be aware that each active index in the Index Selection dialog uses approximately 50K of memory from the application's memory partition. If you add more than three indexes to this list, you may want to consider increasing the Preferred size by 50K for each additional index.If you are not using Acrobat Search you can reduce the Preferred size value for Acrobat Reader 3.0 by an additional 510K (360K for Search and 150K for three indexes).Plug-in Names - Removing plug-ins from the Reader's Plug-Ins folder can improve performance and reduce the  memory required to use the Reader.  When removing plug-ins, refer to the following list of the Reader plug-ins' file names and their functionality:	Acrobat Search        Search  (installed only with Acrobat Reader + Search installer)	Acrobat Weblink     Weblink	AcroForm                  Forms	EWH                          External Window Handler   (communicates with Web browser)	HLS                            Highlight server  (highlights results of Web-based search)	Movie                         Movie and Sound	OLE                           OLE Server  (installed by optional OLE installer)Web Browser Issues=================PDFViewer Browser Plug-in -  Acrobat Reader 3.0 and Netscape Navigator communicate with each other via two plug-ins installed with Adobe Acrobat 3.0; one called "EWH" on the Acrobat side in the "Adobe Acrobat 3.0:Plug-Ins" folder and one called "PDFViewer" in Netscape Navigator's "Plug-ins" folder.  A copy of the "PDFViewer" plug-in is also installed in the "Adobe Acrobat 3.0:Web Browser Plug-in" folder.If you have multiple versions of Netscape Navigator, be sure that the "Plug-ins" folder associated with the version of Netscape you'll be using contains "PDFViewer".Make sure both plug-ins are from the same Acrobat release. Opening an Acrobat document from within a copy of Netscape Navigator which uses an old version of the "PDFViewer" plug-in may cause your browser to crash.   [148104]Using the PDFViewer browser plug-in with a Web browser not fully compatible with Netscape Navigator's plug-in architecture may cause your browser to crash.Microsoft Internet Explorer -  Microsoft Internet Explorer version 2.0 and later for Macintosh has a plug-in folder for Netscape Navigator plug-ins.  However, Internet Explorer versions 2.0 or 2.1 do not fully support PDFViewer (Acrobat's Netscape Navigator plug-in) and may crash when it is used.  Rather than using this plug-in, Adobe recommends that users of Internet Explorer 2.0 or 2.1 configure the Acrobat Reader as a helper application.   [148027]For information about configuring helper applications in Internet Explorer see Help:Customize:filetype.htm in the Internet Explorer documentation or see:    http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/moreinfo/Microsoft Internet Information Server - The Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) version 2.0 distributed with Windows NT Server 4.0 includes built-in support for byteserving (byte range serving) PDF files. However, the shipping version of IIS 2.0 has a bug which causes it not to return all the bytes needed to display some PDF files  (regardless of whether or not the PDF files are optimized).Microsoft has corrected these bugs in updated versions of three Windows NT 4.0 DLL files (httpodbc.dll, infocomm.dll, and w3svc.dll). These updated files will be included with Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 which Microsoft expects to release in December 1996. Before then, Windows NT 4.0 owners can contact Microsoft's pay per incident product support group (in the U.S. their phone number is 800-936-5900) and request "NT hot fix number 56945".  If you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 1, be sure to reinstall this hot fix afterwards.Movie / Netscape Navigator - When viewing a PDF file in the Navigator window, if you click on a movie annotation and there is no movie file on the web server the system will crash. [143803]PDF files with movies and sounds work inside of World WideWeb browsers, but the performance is generally unacceptable. Acrobat's Movie plug-in is best used for disk- and CD-ROM-based applications. [174588]Netscape Navigator 2.0 limitations - Adobe recommends using  Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later with Acrobat Reader rather than Netscape Navigator 2.x (2.0, 2.0.1, or 2.0.2) for the following reasons:  - Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later is required to submit and receive Acrobat Form Data Format (FDF) files over the Web.  - When Acrobat Reader is used as a plug-in to Netscape Navigator 2.x, using Netscape Navigator's File > Print... menu to print PDF documents will cause Navigator to crash; you can print PDF documents using the print icon at the left end of the Acrobat toolbar.- When Acrobat Reader is used as a plug-in to Netscape Navigator 2.x on a 680x0-based Macintosh, causing Netscape Navigator to go back to a previously viewed page while a PDF file is being downloading may cause Navigator to crash. - Navigator 2 does not support printing PDF files displayed in HTML frames.- Navigator 2.0J and Acrobat 3.0 will crash when used on KanjiTalk systems. [152495]The Acrobat Reader 3.0 installer will attempt to install "PDFViewer"  (Acrobat's Netscape Navigator plug-in) in the plug-in folder of Netscape Navigator 2.0 or later.  If you must use Navigator 2.0, 2.0.1, or 2.0.2 and would prefer to use Acrobat Reader as a helper application, be sure to remove "PDFViewer" from Navigator's plug-ins folder and then configure the Acrobat Reader as a helper application.   Netscape Navigator - Printing HTML pages with embedded PDF files will cause Netscape Navigator 3.0 to crash the next time the user goes to a different page.  Netscape has fixed this bug in Navigator 3.0.1. [161267]- Due to a bug in Netscape Navigator 3.0, when viewing PDF within a frame, if you resize the window and quit Navigator before the page is done drawing, Navigator and/or Acrobat will crash. [175265]- If Netscape Navigator 3.0 is running in the background it will ignore the very first request from another application such as the Acrobat Reader.  Requests which might be ignored include clicking on a Weblink in a PDF document, choosing an Acrobat Reader help menu item which opens a Web page, or handling returning an FDF file in response to an HTML form.  If your request has been ignored make the request a second time.  [160925]- Changes to Acrobat preferences while viewing PDF files within Netscape Navigator will not take full effect until you exit Reader and restart. [160324]- When large PDF files which have NOT been optimized for page-at-a-time downloading are downloaded over very slow transmission lines (e.g. slow modems), the Acrobat Reader may "time-out" before the entire file has been downloaded.  Aternatively, the first page of the document may be displayed but changing to another page could result in a blank page being displayed until the document is fully downloaded. [143637, 179356]- When using Navigator's Back button or Go menu to return to a previously viewed PDF document, page 1 of that document may be displayed regardless of the page you were last viewing.  This will occur if the entire document was not downloaded or if the General Preferences "Allow Background Download of Entire File" option was not enabled. [122652]- Pressing the "end" keyboard shortcut to go to the last page may cause Navigator to shift the Acrobat window upwards obscuring a portion of the Acrobat toolbar and displaying a second Acrobat status bar. Clicking Navigator's Reload button will fix this. [143469]-Many of the typical Acrobat keyboard navigation accelerators (arrow keys, page up/down, home/end) are not always available when viewing PDF files within the Netscape Navigator window.  [142844,146972]- When viewing a document which is wider than the browser window and is set to "Hide Window Controls" a horizontal scroll bar appears across the bottom of the browser windows after opening the PDF and using the Hand tool to scroll left and right. The scrollbar is unusable and the window functions as if it didn't exist. [151952]- If a file can be opened by Netscape Navigator you can open it by draging its icon into a Navigator window and dropping it onto an HTML page; however, dropping a file onto a PDF page displayed in Navigator will not open it.- The filename extension ".pdf" must be at the end of the PDF file name in order to use the drag-and-drop method of opening a PDF file in the Netscape Navigator browser. [153245]- To open a PDF file from Navigator's File > OpenÉ command, you need to hold down the Option key when opening the dialog to be able to select a PDF file from the list; otherwise, only HTML and TEXT files are displayed in the Open dialog. [163393]- Use the Page Setup command in Acrobat Reader to affect the printing of PDF documents viewed within Navigator; Navigator's Page Setup dialog has no effect when printing PDF files.- Navigator mail enclosures of PDF don't open properly in Navigator. [163103]- "Open File" links and bookmarks to non-PDF files will not work when activated while viewing the PDF file in the Netscape Navigator window. [147871]- Using "marginwidth" and "marginheight" in the HTML for a frame which contains a PDF file results in the PDF file being positioned improperly. This is a bug in Navigator that Netscape plans to fix in Navigator 4.0. [162546]Documents with pages larger than 4 MBytes each may have display problems. [155364]  Weblink - When viewing a PDF file in a web browser, the destination of a Weblink is not displayed in the control bar even if the Weblink preference is set to do so. [144784] When opening a PDF file from the Web using Netscape Navigator, if other applications running on your Macintosh are using large amounts of CPU time and the  "Allow Background Download of Entire File" option in the Acrobat General Preferences dialog is enabled you may have to wait until most of the document has downloaded before the first page will be displayed.  [174552]Netscape Navigator / Forms Posting and Receiving - Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later is required to submit and receive Acrobat form files (called FDF files or Forms Data Format files) over the Web.  - To allow posting and receiving FDF forms data to/from a secure server to work properly, turn on the Navigator Network Preferences Option "Allow Persistent Caching of Pages Retrieved through SSL".Netscape Navigator / HTML Form Returning FDF File - The very first time you use Netscape Navigator to submits an HTML form which returns an FDF file, Navigator will display a dialog which says you have started to download a file of type application/vnd.fdf.  Click the "Pick App..." button and select the Acrobat Reader you use with Netscape. [160928]Weblink - Weblinks to an invalid URL or secure site do not pass control to NetscapeNavigator. [117258,117346]- Webinks to "mailto" and "newsgroups" URLs do not work correctly. [149676, 175397]General Issues=============4-Color Mode - If the Monitor control panel is set to 4 colors, Acrobat Reader uses the system's highlight color in its color palette which results in poor color rendering of images. Work around: Increase the number of colors available to your computer by selecting the Monitors control panel and clicking on a larger number of colors.Adobe Type Reunion 1.2 - Adobe Type Reunion 1.2 is not compatible with the Forms plug-in in Acrobat 3.0. Solution: Upgrade to Adobe Type Reunion 2.0. [150044]Calibrated Color - The "Use Calibrated Color for Display" option in the General Preferences dialog is only functional if you have the Acrobat Device-Independent Color plug-in installed. [163728] Continuous View and Notes - Text notes which extend outside (above or below) of the page boundary when viewed in Single Page mode may get clipped when you switch to Continuous or Continuous - Facing Pages mode. Solution: Click on the note to activate it and it will pop to the surface. [148150]  Desktop Printing (GX) - If QuickDraw GX is enabled, Acrobat Reader requires Desktop Printing to be turned on to print.Font Not Found - A font not found error may indicate that ATM did not have enough memory to create a substitute font. Increase the size of the ATM font cache to solve the problem. See the ATM section of this file for information on how to increase the memory (font cache) available to ATM.Full Screen Preferences - Changes to full-screen preferences do not take effect until you exit and re-enter full-screen mode. [163985]Making PDF documents accessible from the Macintosh Finder - PDF files created on Windows or UNIX systems will have a PDF icon and cannot be opened on the Macintosh by double-clicking. To enable double- clicking to open the PDF files, do one of the following:- Open the file on the Macintosh using File > Open or dragging the icon onto the Acrobat Reader icon. After you have opened the file on the Macintosh once, the next time the Finder redisplays the icon (e.g. because you have moved it or simply closed and opened the folder containing it ) it will display a PDF icon, enabling opening by  double-clicking.-  Use the PDF Type Utility to set the file type and creator on the Macintosh.To use the utility, you simply drag PDF files created on another platform to it. The utility adds the appropriate information so you can open the files by double-clicking.The PDF Type Utility (Macintosh) is available in the Utility folder on the Acrobat Reader 3.0 CD-ROM.  It can also be found on the Web by following the pointer on     http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/moreinfo/Movie / Full Screen - When viewing a movie in full-screen mode, hitting the Esc key, (which normally causes the movie to stop playing) may instead take the user out of full-screen mode. [118431]Movie Posters - Movie posters do not print. [164996]OLE plug-in - If you have installed the optional OLE plug-in you can incorporate PDF documents in compound documents created with any Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) 1.0 or 2.0 container application.  An installer for the OLE plug-in can be found on the Acrobat Reader 3.0 CD-ROM and can redistributed for no charge.  - The Acrobat Reader cannot be used to to insert or create objects with OLE Embedding because you cannot use Reader to save or make changes to a PDF file. [117835]OLE and Links/Bookmarks/Movies - Links and bookmarks to other PDF files and playback of external movie and sound files will not work if the PDF file is embedded as an OLE object. [109027,118373]  Page Caching - When page caching is enabled, caching is active when there is no mouse movement. If you have the zoom-in tool selected and press the option key to toggle to zoom-out, you may not see the cursor change until you move the mouse, which in effect interrupts page caching.Password Field - The password field will accept 255 characters, but only the first 32 are used. [110590]   PowerBook External Display - Acrobat Reader may not display correctly when running on a PowerBook 180 with an external display, mirroring on, and in monochrome (1-bit) mode. Solution: Turn off mirroring. Set up the external monitor as monitor 2 and make the external monitor the primary monitor by dragging the MacOS menu bar to monitor 2 (within the Monitors control panel), then restart.QuickDraw GX - Acrobat Reader is compatible with QuickDraw GX, but it does not use any specific QuickDraw GX features.- Based on whether QuickDraw GX is enabled or not at the time of installing Acrobat Reader, different versions of the Adobe Acrobat substitution fonts Adobe Sans MM and Adobe Serif MM (and perhaps other Type 1 fonts) are installed. Later, if QuickDraw GX is either enabled or disabled, you will need to reinstall Acrobat Reader, using the Easy Install option. This will make sure the proper version of the fonts required by Acrobat Reader are installed in their proper locations. If you install System 7.5 and QuickDraw GX 1.0 after installing Acrobat Reader, you will need to re-install  Acrobat Reader. The QuickDraw GX 1.0 installer unfortunately replaces ATM 4.0 with ATM GX (ATM 3.7), which is not compatible with Acrobat Reader.- N-up printing does not work with the QuickDraw GX PostScript printer driver. [144248]QuickDraw Printing - Background printing to QuickDraw printers may be very slow. [176817]Rotated/Transformed TrueType Fonts - You may encounter some problems with displaying or printing rotated or otherwise transformed TrueType fonts. This is a limitation of TrueType and QuickDraw.Search plug-in - The Acrobat Search plug-in allows searches of text in PDF files on a local hard disk or CD-ROM or across a local area network.  (Searching PDF files stored on a Web-server requires a Web-server-based search engine.)  The Acrobat Reader is available with or without the Search plug-in.  Acrobat Reader with Search can be found on the Acrobat Reader 3.0 CD-ROM and can redistributed for no charge.    For known problems and issues related to the Search plug-in see the ReadMe-Search file installed with Acrobat Reader with Search.Sound Actions - The playback of sound actions cannot be stopped by the user (as opposed to the ability to stop the playback of QuickTime movies and sounds by pressing the Esc key). Sound actions can only be stopped by playing another sound action. [152859]TrueType - TrueType fonts cannot be reencoded. Because of this limitation, documents that were created using some special characters in a Type 1 font that are not accessible if a TrueType version of the same font with the same name is installed on your system. When this happens, the error message "Some text in the font and character 'FONTNAME ###' could not be displayed or printed correctly. The font could not be reencoded." is displayed. Since the Acrobat installers do not replace TrueType versions of Times, Helvetica, and Courier you may get this message with these fonts. TrueType in Files created on Windows - Files created on Windows and containing TrueType fonts may not display or print correctly.  Macintosh users may see boxes where characters should be.Postscript Printing Issues=====================Adobe PSPrinter 8.3.1 PostScript Printer Driver - For best results, we recommend you use the PSPrinter 8.3.1 (or later) driver from Adobe. This driver can available on the Adobe Web site at "http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/printerdrivers/" and in the "Drivers" folder on the Acrobat Reader 3.0 CD-ROM.Adobe Type Manager (ATM) and Background Printing - If you are using the private copy of ATM in the Adobe Acrobat 3.0 / Fonts folder (i.e. you do not have ATM installed in your System's Control Panels folder) background printing is disabled when the using PSPrinter or LaserWriter 8.x printer drivers. Background printing is still enabled when using the LaserWriter 7.x printer drivers. If you are using the LaserWriter 8.4.x printer driver, you must explicitly turn off background printing in the print dialog.PostScript Level 2 - If you are printing to a PostScript Level 2 device using the Adobe PSPrinter 8.x or Apple LaserWriter 8 printer drivers, you need to update the Printer Info after selecting the printer from the Chooser in order for the printer driver to recognize the printer supports PostScript Level 2. If this is not done, Acrobat Reader will not send PostScript Level 2 information to the printer. When properly set up, there will be an icon to the left of your printer name in the Chooser. During set up, make sure to select the specific PostScript Printer Description (PPD) file for your particular printer - do not select the "Generic" PPD if at all possible.Print Monitor Setting - PrintMonitor may run out of memory when printing PDF files with background printing is turned on. As a precaution against this happening, you may want to change PrintMonitor's current memory size. To do this, open the Extensions folder within the System Folder. Select the PrintMonitor application and select Get Info from the File menu. At the bottom of the Get Info window, there is a field under Memory for Current Size. Increase this value to 170K or greater; if necessary, try increasing it to 256K.Memory Issues - If you encounter problems, such as a "VMerror," printing to PostScript Level 1 or 2 printers, it may be because the printer has little available memory (for example, a non-upgraded LaserWriter, LaserWriter Plus, LaserWriter II NT or NTX). There are two potential solutions to this problem: (1) In the Preferences dialog (select from the Edit menu) you may choose to use  Serif only or Sans only for font substitution. This frees up additional memory in the printer and chances are your document will print successfully. (2) The other option is to purchase more memory for your printer. See the ATM READ ME for additional information about printing.Apple Personal LaserWriter NT - If you are using an Apple Personal LaserWriter NT printer that has not been upgraded to a Personal LaserWriter NTR, Acrobat Reader won't be able to print substitute fonts. Contact your Apple dealer for information on upgrading your printer.QuickDraw GX - If QuickDraw GX is enabled, Acrobat Reader requires Desktop Printing to be turned on to print.=============================================================================Adobe, Acrobat, Adobe Type Manager, and PageMill are trademarks of Adobe Systems Incorporated.

During the find operation the Find dialog's "Cancel" button will not function.  The find operation can be stopped using command-period or the escape key.Select, Copy, Find, and Find Again must be done using the tools on the Acrobat toolbar.  The "Copy", "Select All", and "Find..." menu items on your browser's "Edit" menu will not invoke the corresponding command on PDF documents.=============================================================================Other Known IssuesBlank Pages in Web Browsers - Some pages of PDF files may appear blank when viewed within Web browsers.  This may occur if the PDF file is being served from an early versions of some Web servers (such as the Microsoft Internet Information Server version 2.0).  Users can view such PDF files by saving a copy locally.  Webmasters may need to update their server to the latest version (for more information see http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/byteserve.html ).Documentation Errata - On page 7 of the Acrobat Reader 3.0 Online Guide (READER.PDF) in the "Opening PDF documents" section it says "The document author can set PDF documents to be opened in full- screen mode, without a toolbar, menu bar, or window controls. ...To override all the authorÕs document-opening settings, press Control+ Shift (Windows and UNIX) or Option+ Shift (Macintosh) when opening the file."  This capability to override all the authorÕs document-opening settings is available in Acrobat Exchange but is NOT available in Acrobat Reader.Launching external applications / Security - PDF files may contain instructions to launch an external application or to open a non-PDF file.  To enhance the security of PDF files , in Acrobat Reader and Exchange version 3.01 will prompt users with an alert before launching an external application, an executable file or a command.  The alert will say: "Acrobat is about to launch this application: " [Application] "Allow this action (OK) or all actions to all applications (all)?"  followed by three buttons, "OK", "Cancel", and "All".  - Choosing "OK" will allow only this instance of this action.  - Choosing "Cancel" will prevent this instance of this action.- Choosing "All" will allow all instances of all actions, thus disabling the alert until Acrobat is exited and restarted.GXGraphics extension and Printing - If the GXGraphics extension is on, Type 1 fonts will not print using LaserWriter 8.4.x unless the font is installed in the System's Fonts folder. [211792]Movie / Netscape Navigator - If you try to play a movie in a floating window from a PDF file within Netscape, you'll hear the audio and when the movie is done playing, the rectangle where the video should have been playing will turn white.  [198949]System Requirements - Acrobat 3.0 did not run on Macintosh System 7.0 or System 7.0.1.  Acrobat v. 3.01 should run on Macintosh System 7.0 or later.=============================================================================Adobe Acrobat Reader - Platforms, Availability, and Redistribution Versions of the Acrobat Reader and Acrobat Reader with Search are available for 16-bit Windows (Windows 3.1), 32-bit Windows (Windows 95, NT 3.51, and NT 4.0), Macintosh, Sun Solaris, SunOS, HP-UX, IBM AIX, and SGI IRIX.

Using the Formula Glossary may be practical if you've created formulas in earlier versions of Word and you want to update an existing formula or add an occasional new formula using a known method. Generally, though, it is easier to use the new Microsoft Equation Editor. You simply click from a palette to add values (including symbols) into templates for different types of formulas. For information about using the Equation Editor, see the Microsoft Equation Editor User's Guide.IMPORTANT: To display and print formulas in this document or your own documents, the LaserWriter Symbol font must be installed in the current system.To produce formulas with the Formula Glossary, you insert combinations of typesetting commands stored in the glossary into your document, and then replace the placeholder text with the values you want. When necessary, you can add the Greek characters and other special symbols stored in the glossary as values in a formula. The ready-made formulas in the glossary may be sufficient to meet your needs, but, if necessary, you can add other typesetting commands. For information about putting together your own formulas with typesetting commands and a description of all formula command options, see Appendix H, "Formulas," in the Microsoft Word User's Guide.Opening the Formula Glossary and Inserting EntriesBefore inserting and editing formula entries, choose Show ¦ button on the ribbon. With Show ¦ selected, you will be able to see the complete typesetting commands, including the command formatting options and the list of arguments.Choose Hide ¦ to see the formula as it will look when it is printed. If the formula does not look correct, choose Show ¦ again, and check the command for errors, such as missing characters.Opening the Formula GlossaryBefore you can insert formulas or symbols from the Formula Glossary, you must open the Formula Glossary so that its entries are available.If youÕve installed Word with the Easy Install option, the Formula Glossary will be in the Glossaries folder within the folder youÕve designated for Word.1.	From the Edit menu, choose Glossary.2.	With the Glossary dialog box open, choose New from the File menu to clear all entries except those supplied with Word.3.	If Word asks if you want to delete nonstandard entries, click Yes.	Deleting the nonstandard (user-defined) entries does not remove them from the glossary that is currently open. These entries are only removed if you choose to save the glossary after deleting the entries.4.	With the Glossary dialog box open, from the File menu, choose Open.5.	 In the Glossaries folder, double-click Formula Glossary.Inserting a Formula Command or SymbolYou insert the glossary entries using the Glossary command on the Edit menu or the Insert Glossary Text keyboard command.You can also use these commands to insert Greek characters and symbols.To insert a glossary entry using the mouse:1.	From the Edit menu, choose Glossary.2.	Click one of the glossary entry names.3.	Click Insert.To insert a glossary entry using the keyboard:1.	Press Command+Backspace or Command+Delete.2.	Type the glossary entry name. You only need to type enough of the name to make the name unique.3.	Press Enter.Using the Formula EntriesThe following listings describe the content and display the effect of formula entries in this glossary. Each entry consists of:¥	A formula character (þ) and a one-letter command identifier.¥	Formatting options. Note that all possible formatting options are not used in any one formula glossary entry. You can use different options and change the option parameters. Formatting options can be in uppercase or lowercase letters. ¥	Text, numbers, and other characters to be printed in the formula, enclosed within parentheses. You must separate the items in parentheses with commas.In the formula entry descriptions, the characters in bold and the parentheses enclosing arguments are required for the formula to be printed correctly. Words in all capital letters are ÒplaceholderÓ arguments that you replace with your own information. Depending on the font you use, some formulas may look a little different in your own documents than they do in this one. You can change the font of formula entries as you do with any other characters; however, do not change the Greek characters or other symbols in the Symbol font.Formula Entry DescriptionsAbs (absolute value)This entry:	Is printed like this:þBþbcþ|(REPLACE)	Bbc|(REPLACE)Example:þBþbcþ|(4x + 20)	BBC|(4x + 20)ArrayThis entry:	Is printed like this:þAþalþhs5þco1(LIST,ARRAY,HERE)	Aalhs5co1(LIST,ARRAY,HERE)Example:þAþalþhs7þco3(1,2,33,4,55,6,777,8,99)	Aalco3HS7(1,2,33,4,55,6,777,8,99)In the formula glossary entry, þA is the formula command, and the following are formatting options:þal	Aligns columns leftþcon	Formats array in specified number of columnsþhsn	Specifies spacing (in points) between columnsBackwardThis entry:	Is printed like this:þDþba5()REPLACE	Dba5()REPLACEExample:OþDþba2()E	ODba2()EThe option þba decreases the specified amount of space (in points) between the preceding and next character.

Some entries are made up of PostScript code that directs your LaserWriter or other PostScript printer to draw lines or add specialized text to a page. Other entries are based on Word styles and format text so it appears in a certain way on the page. Many of the glossary entries are based on Word's default page and margin sizes or make assumptions about content, line position, line width, font, and font size. You may have to make adjustments to these entries to fit your specific needs.The table below lists the entries in the Page Layout Glossary and indicates which changes you might commonly make, if any. EntryTypeChanges You Can MakeCrop MarksPostScript¥	Length and width of crop mark line¥	White space within crop mark¥	Crop mark position to adjust distance from page edge or for different page sizeLine Between ColumnsPostScript¥	Line width¥	Indent from top and bottom margins to control where line draw startsMargin NoteWord Style¥	Content¥	Note width¥	Distance from textPage Border - LandscapePostScript¥	Line width¥	Line position to adjust distance from page edge or for different page sizePage Border - PortraitPostScript¥	Line width¥	Line position to adjust distance from page edge or for different page sizePleading Paper/Line NumbersPostScript¥	Fits existing standardRotate Landscape Page NumbersPostScript¥	Starting number¥	Font and font size¥	Page number placementSide HeadWord Style¥	Content¥	Note width¥	Distance from textWord Under TextPostScript¥	Content¥	Font and font sizeIMPORTANT:  The PostScript entries in the Page Layout Glossary are formatted as hidden text. In order to get the effect the PostScript entry intends, you must clear (uncheck) the Print Hidden Text check box in the Print dialog box. If the Print Hidden Text check box is selected, your printer will print the actual PostScript codes in the document rather than use the instructions to create a page layout effect.Opening the Page Layout GlossaryBefore you can insert page layout entries, you must open the Page Layout Glossary so that the entries are available. You can open the Page Layout Glossary by itself or merge it with the current glossary. If you have installed Word with the Easy Install option, the Page Layout Glossary will be in the Glossaries folder within the folder youÕve designated for Word.1.	From the Edit menu, choose Glossary.2.	Do one of the following:	If you want to merge the Page Layout Glossary, skip to step 4 below.	If you want to open the Page Layout glossary by itself, make sure the Glossary dialog box is open, then choose New from the File menu to clear all entries except those supplied with Word.3.	If Word asks if you want to delete nonstandard entries, click Yes.	Deleting the nonstandard (user-defined) entries does not remove them from the glossary that is currently open. These entries are only removed if you choose to save the glossary after deleting the entries.4.	With the Glossary dialog box open, choose Open from the File menu.5.	In the Glossaries folder, double-click Page Layout Glossary.Inserting a Page Layout EntryAfter positioning the insertion point, you can insert entries from the Page Layout Glossary using the Glossary command on the Edit menu or the Insert Glossary Text keyboard command.For a margin note or sidehead (both created with style-formatted entries), insert the entry just above the paragraph you want it to appear next to. If you want a heading for a margin note, insert a Side Head entry above the Margin Note entry .All other entries are PostScript entries. If you want to print a PostScript effect on a single page, you can insert the entry anywhere on the page, although it's probably most convenient if the entry is at the top of the page, separated from the rest of the content. Most often, you will want to print PostScript effects on every page of a document, and in this case, you insert the entry in a header. For details, see "Printing a Page Layout Effect on Every Page" below.To insert a glossary entry with the Glossary command:1.	From the Edit menu, choose Glossary.2.	Click one of the glossary entry names.3.	Click Insert.To insert a glossary entry using the keyboard:1.	Press Command+Backspace or Command+Delete.2.	Type the glossary entry name. You only need to type enough of the name to make the name unique.3.	Press Enter.Printing a Page Layout Effect on Every PageTo print an entry on every page, you insert it into a header.1.	From the Format menu, choose Document.2.	In the Top Margins drop-down list box, click Exactly, and then click OK.3.	From the View menu, choose Header.4.	In the header window, insert the desired glossary entry.Changing PostScript EntriesThere are common changes you might make to the entries in the Page Layout GlossaryÑand there are common guidelines that apply. The following general information will help you when you make specific changes to the PostScript entries that are described later in this document. Typically, you will change a definition or measurement in a line or two of PostScript code. For more substantive changes, refer to an appropriate source for information about PostScript.MeasurementsMeasurements in the Page Layout Glossary's PostScript entries are figured in points, with 72 points equaling 1 inch. These measurements apply to line widths, fonts, and the coordinates used to map out drawing positions on a page. The line width defined for Page Layout entries is 0.5 points, but you can narrow the width to the minimum your printer prints, and widen it as much as you want. Drawing positions start at the lower-left corner of the page (0,0), and then move up and to the right from there. For example, the position 36,36 is 0.5 inch up and to the right of the lower-left corner. For information about how measurements are applied to fonts, see "Available fonts and font sizes" below.Available fonts and font sizesIf you want to change the font in a PostScript entry, you can use any of the fonts that are resident in your printer. You type the replacement font name in the PostScript code, using a name your printer recognizes. The LaserWriter Plus, later LaserWriters, and LaserWriter emulators usually have the 35 fonts listed below. If you're not sure which fonts your printer supports or want to see these fonts, refer to your printer manual.AvantGarde-BookHelveticaPalatino-BoldAvantGarde-BookObliqueHelvetica-BoldPalatino-BoldItalicAvantGarde-DemiHelvetica-BoldObliquePalatino-ItalicAvantGarde-DemiObliqueHelvetica-NarrowPalatino-RomanBookman-DemiHelvetica-Narrow-BoldSymbolBookman-DemiItalicHelvetica-Narrow-BoldObliqueTimes-BoldBookman-LightHelvetica-Narrow-ObliqueTimes-BoldItalicBookman-LightItalicHelvetica-ObliqueTimes-ItalicCourierNewCenturySchlbk-BoldTimes-RomanCourier-BoldNewCenturySchlbk-BoldItalicZapfChancery-MediumItalicCourier-BoldObliqueNewCenturySchlbk-ItalicZapfDingbatsCourier-ObliqueNewCenturySchlbk-RomanTo change the size of a font in PostScript, you use point measurements to specify the font size. For example, to change the font and size in the Rotate Landscape Page Numbers entry, you would change one line of PostScript code as follows:Change:	Times-Roman findfont 12 scalefont setfontTo:	Helvetica findfont 14 scalefont setfontNotes on EntriesThese notes describe the entries in the Page Layout Glossary and show how you can make changes to them. After you insert an entry in a document and make a change, you can save the entry back in the Page Layout Glossary with the same or another entry name. If you want to print glossary entries, choose Print when the Glossary dialog box is open.Crop MarksThis entry adds crop marks at a specified distance from the edges of the page.Change this line of codeTo.5 setlinewidthSet crop mark line width./markl 9 defSet length of crop mark in points./whitel 4 defSet length of white space inside of crop mark. /top 72 defSet distance from top edge of page to upper side of crop mark. /bottom 72 defSet distance from bottom edge of page to lower side of crop mark. /left 90 defSet distance from left edge of page to left side of crop mark. /right 90 defSet distance from right edge of page to right side of crop mark.Line Between ColumnsThis entry draws vertical lines between all newspaper-style columns on the page. The entry is not intended to work with the columns in tablesChange this line of codeTo.5 setlinewidthSet crop mark line width./indent 18 defSet indent in points from top/bottom margin to start of line.Margin Notes and Side HeadThese entries fit within Word's default 1.5-inch left margin. You insert an entry just above the paragraph you want it to appear next to. To change the content or font within a margin note or sidehead, use Word's standard editing and formatting commands.If you widen the left margin in a document, you can change the width of a margin note or sidehead and also its distance from the main body of text. Place the insertion point in the entry and choose Frame from the Format menu. You can then adjust the measurements in the Frame Width and From Text boxes.Note:  The total of these two numbers added to the width of the unprintable region at the left of the page must not exceed the total margin width. You can check your printer manual or use the trial and error method if you are uncertain of the width and effect of the unprintable region for your printer.Page Border - LandscapeThis entry draws a border around an 8.5- by 11-inch page that is printed in landscape orientation (horizontal). The border is 0.5 inch from the paper edge. You can change the line width and also move the border so it's a different distance from the paper edge or works for a different-size page.Change this line of codeTo.5 setlinewidthSet page border line width.36 36 movetoSet starting point for line draw, calculated in points from the lower-left corner of the page, first on the X-axis and then the Y-axis.0 540 rlinetoSpecify that a line be drawn 540 points up from the starting point.720 0 rlinetoSpecify that a line be drawn 720 points right from the current point.0 -540 rlinetoSpecify that a line be drawn 540 points down from the current point.The closepath command, which is also part of the code for this entry, specifies that a line be drawn from the end of the third line to the starting point, which completes the border. You do not have to change this command when you change any of the other lines.Page Border - PortraitThis entry draws a border around an 8.5- by 11-inch page that is printed in portrait orientation (vertical). The border is 0.5 inch from the paper edge. You can change the line width and also move the border so it's a different distance from the paper edge or works for a different-size page.Change this line of codeTo.5 setlinewidthSet page border line width.36 36 movetoSet starting point for line draw, calculated in points from the lower-left corner of the page, first on the X axis and then the Y axis.0 720 rlinetoSpecify that a line be drawn 720 points up from the starting point.540 0 rlinetoSpecify that a line be drawn 540 points right from the current point.0 -720 rlinetoSpecify that a line be drawn 720 points down from the current point.The closepath command, which is also part of the code for this entry, specifies that a line be drawn from the end of the third line to the starting point, which completes the border. You do not have to change this command when you change any of the other lines.Pleading Paper/Line NumbersThis entry adds line numbers and a double vertical line in the left margin of an 8.5- by 11-inch page. The left margin of the document must be at least 1.25 inches wide to allow room for the line numbers; otherwise, the line numbers are printed on top of the text. If necessary, use the Document command on the Format menu to change the margin width.Rotate Landscape Page NumbersThis entry rotates page numbers on a landscape page. When you turn the landscape page "up and to the right" into portrait position, the page number is printed in the same direction as those on portrait pages. You can print numbers so that in portrait position they will be at the upper middle, upper right, lower middle, or lower right of the page. Note: You must make a change to code to choose one of these options. You remove a "%" from the beginning of a line to "turn on" the option of your choice.

If you don't want any characters to precede the page number, delete all characters within parentheses in both lines of code shown.When you mix portrait and landscape pages, you have to create each portrait and landscape portion of your overall document as a separate Word document. For example, you might create a five-page introduction as a portrait document, create three pages of charts as a landscape document, and then follow with several portrait pages in a third document. To set the number sequence for a second or later document, including a landscape document, follow the steps in "To start numbering pages with a number other than 1," in Chapter 22, "Numbering Pages," in the Microsoft Word User's Guide.If the page numbers on landscape and portrait pages are in slightly different positions, you can adjust the landscape page numbers as described above or adjust the portrait page number position as described in the "Numbering Pages" chapter.Word Under TextThis entry prints a large gray-shaded "CONFIDENTIAL" diagonally across the page beneath the normal text of your document.
