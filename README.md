# aetherWorks

a fork of [Infinite Mac](https://github.com/mihaip/infinite-mac) optimized and customized to be able to be used as a curation tooling for net-art, interactive experiences and ARG's for decentralized web.

## Development

The app has been optimized to be deployable to fleek, a decentralized hosting service that serves files from IPFS. However you can choose your own provider or self-host.

TBA- End goal is to develop tooling so artists/curators can curate their own works and interactive galleries along with the developed tooling with little to no code experience. the tooling will provide you with a custom build that you can customize the emulated machine, drag and drop your assets with a provided wiki to optimize your videos, using resEdit/Kaleidoscope to customize OS UI's, html wrappers and fleek guide on how to run it on decentralized web, and more!

### Dependencies

This project works along infinite-mac, and would have been impossible without Mihai Parparita's exquisite work. if you enjoy our work, consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/mihaip) them and [Macintosh Repository](https://www.macintoshrepository.org/) for their archival work of abandonware
